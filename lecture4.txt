Welcome back, everyone. Lecture number four and a quantum simulation class. Today we're going to start talking about optical lattices.
0:03
And yeah,
0:10
let's first start with what is an optical that is and how do we create an optical that we already talked about the Typekit Typekit effect potential?
0:12
So we now just have to talk about how we can create like a periodic intensity distribution
0:19
for the light because that wouldn't directly be seen as a periodic potential for the atoms.
0:23
And the easiest way to doing it is actually pretty straightforward. You take two plane waves with the same frequency we have across K and minus K,
0:29
so one laser coming from here and another laser identical frequency coming from there.
0:37
And then, of course, you have the two plane waves, each like x plus each of the minus ICAC's.
0:42
And that's how you can write as a sign of or cosine k x, which means you get an electric field,
0:46
which is a standing wave, which is just a sudden, subtle pattern.
0:51
So the easiest way of doing it literally is take my laser beam focus down onto my atoms.
0:56
And then just shortly behind the atoms, a millimetre a few minutes apart. I put a mirror to the whole thing gets reflected.
1:01
That's the easiest way of doing it. And it's actually a way it works.
1:06
The electric feud is Cosine, which means that the intensity is cosine squared and the dipole effect is proportional to the intensity,
1:12
so we see the potential to form cosine squared kicks. The way we typically write this down is very often we just say, OK,
1:19
as long as that x squared case that and then we have like a plus or minus sign in front and b not where we noticed.
1:26
Just let us know. So if not for us, it's always a positive number.
1:33
And then if we have a Blue Ridge with letters so that let us potential as we positive,
1:37
then if you want zero potential line down here and we get like the positive sign.
1:42
And if we have the negative sign, we have gratitude. Letters for the letters is attractive.
1:46
So depending on where we you retuned the line of zero intensity as that line of zero potential oil, I don't see your potential up here.
1:51
But it's always a periodic potential. And this latter step to be not.
1:57
We typically give in units of the vehicle energy that becomes a natural unit for us that we call energy is the kinetic energy that a particle has,
2:02
but it initially was addressed and then it absorbs the momentum kick of one photo.
2:10
So it's just the kinetic energy p-square,
2:14
but an after the atom mass at addressed has absorbed a photon at their right to keep momentum peak of that photon.
2:16
So it's witness K squared over two m.
2:24
And this is the week the typical energy scare will always use, who would always talk about letter steps and we call energy,
2:29
and that means it's as we call energy, of course, depends on so it depends on the wavelength of the laser and it depends on the mass of the atom.
2:35
So if you have different atoms in your system, they would see different depths of lattices in this appropriate unit.
2:42
OK. Let us facing this lambda over to.
2:48
East anyway, because if a cosine squared the period of the fingers lambda over to half the wavelength,
2:53
and that typically means for us a couple of hundred nanometres 250 to 600 nanometres are the typical values.
2:58
And that's again, the big difference to our system where the let us constants in all of angstrom,
3:04
but he is much, much, much bigger five orders of magnitude bigger, also three orders of magnitude bigger.
3:10
And that means that it's much, much easier to observe to manipulate and things happen much, much slower.
3:15
So we can do more than just a simple, a simple standing way if we can, for instance,
3:21
take by chromatic letters by chromatic true colours where we have let us laser off wavelengths blunder and then other wonderful reference to London.
3:26
So you get like this potential plus that potential.
3:34
And these are true super lattices and depending on how strong these lasers are and they're ready to face, which means like how do they sit well,
3:37
as if to each other, you can change things dynamically during the ramp up and you can, but two very different lattices.
3:45
So one type of lattice that's interesting is the letters of some symmetric double world.
3:52
So we have like one week barrier two identical cases and then the big barrier.
3:56
And then again, here, w-well, just means you have two worlds and one and this is mathematically speaking,
4:00
these four Hegar model becomes a model where you have like one tunnelling another, tunnelling one another again.
4:06
And these models are interesting. You might have seen them in TQM because they like the simple topological models.
4:11
You don't need to know the details just to say, okay, you can do things like this.
4:19
And then you can, of course, also if you just shift the London letters with respect to the tool and the letters a little bit,
4:22
you've got a cemetery in there. You can add to to one well, it's always deeper than the upper.
4:29
And that's very nice for many things, because you can, for instance, if load atoms.
4:34
In there, so I say a first load atoms, just one atom, put it aside and the long wavelength letters,
4:38
and then I ramp up the short wavelength that this will start to splits this big well into a double well.
4:43
And they do it in an asymmetric fashion. I can make sure the particles are always sitting on the left side.
4:48
And if I then say only go to the London, let the switch off to to London,
4:53
then I'm in touch, let this with particles only starting on every other side.
4:58
So if artificially created the charge density wave and can see it's an iron state will dissolve over time, what would it do?
5:01
It's a very important observable later on. So there's a lot of things that you can do with.
5:07
If you want to let go to more than one dimension, if you, for instance, want to create a simple cubic lattice in three dimensions,
5:12
then you want to write down the letters potentially like this Vex letters that letter
5:19
step the next direction times cosine squared x plus b by plus visit and so on.
5:23
And.
5:28
In order to create this now, you want to have the interference always between the beam going forward and the beam being reflected in this direction.
5:29
But what you have to avoid is now the interference between the two beams.
5:36
So if you also have this beam at this beam being coherent, you also get interference between those.
5:41
And that's not what you want in a simple cubic potential. So you just have to play a little bit of tricks.
5:46
So one way to avoid this cross interference is to say, let's use a fork and polarisations.
5:51
So if the one is stuck in that direction, the other one is the direction that it can't interfere.
5:56
That turns out not to work very well in practise because you never get polarisations perfectly orthogonal,
6:01
what works very well in practise is to say if I just have small frequency offsets between the views just say 10 megahertz frequency offset,
6:07
which is easy to do in the lab, then you get interference term.
6:14
But this interference oscillates with 10 megahertz so much, much, much faster than the atoms can follow.
6:17
And they only see the average potential and the cosine average is down to zero.
6:23
So you don't have this term, then. So that's how you create like a square lettuce and 2D or a simple cubic lattice in 3D.
6:27
So in cartoon language, if I just take one laser focus at home, I just get my Typekit truck one attractive potential.
6:34
If I put like a mirror, he's going to get a little reflective case.
6:41
Then I get a one that mentioned letters in this direction you can see in a transfer it still has like the shape of the of that you get from,
6:43
like the single laser beam, but longitudinally you now have this periodic potential of the lettuce.
6:51
If you take problems in the plane, pairwise interferences, you get like that the checkerboard type thing.
6:55
And if you get like the thing in 3-D, then you get like that ahead on the first flight.
7:01
So strictly speaking, this isn't every potential line of the three dimensional potential.
7:06
And it just looks good. OK, so this is kind of the main workhorse for a lot of the physics that we're going to look at.
7:11
You can also do that with different letter systems. So you can, for instance, say let's take three beams in a plane.
7:17
So if you have a three foot rotation symmetry in the system,
7:22
you can use identical frequencies so that they are all interfering in plane out of plane polarisation, gratitude through the joint.
7:24
And then you can get, for instance, the honeycomb letters or the two are angular letters.
7:30
And one thing that we not doing, for instance, of my crew at the moment, is we're saying, OK,
7:35
it's not from these kind of structures and to this one in a biometric patient with London to London, and then you can create, for instance, the cargo.
7:38
Let us. So there's a lot of things how you can create letter structures with code items.
7:45
There's many, many ways of doing this. It's a very flexible system. What's very nice about this is that these protections are always very, very clean,
7:50
they have almost no disorder and then they're very, very close to perfect.
7:58
And when you think about that, it makes sense when you think about this and furious based.
8:02
Normally when you project down, the potential, there might be a little bit of disorder here,
8:06
something changing here and then you get like, it is a potential. Now what we're doing is that we are if you think in case basis,
8:10
we are only coming in with two vectors, one laser beam from here, one laser beam from there.
8:16
And therefore, these took because the only thing that they can do is sign.
8:20
Because we're kind of like restricting ourselves in case basis and say we only come in with two discrete vectors.
8:24
We must have a perfectly periodic potential because we just don't have enough freedom to do anything else.
8:29
And that's like a big benefit of the system. OK.
8:34
So how do we know the items in there and in principal can just stop here and say, well, it's a periodic potential.
8:38
So we have lost fuel and we have clockwise. We have a band structure with energy gaps.
8:43
All of the things you know and love from condensed metaphysics are there and therefore we cannot go on if you already know the description.
8:48
Let me just highlight a few points about this,
8:54
because there's a few things in there because we are thinking of creating the letters, so to speak, in momentum space.
8:56
There's like a neat way and I need intuition how you can think about this.
9:02
This gives you like novel insights compared to like how you think about in kind of metaphysics.
9:05
Let's start from the clinic's bedside bedside to say we have lost fear.
9:10
So if we have a probability potential, then all of the EIGEN functions for electrons or any particles in the air will be of the following form.
9:15
Normally in free space, I would have just applied way to the ICAC's.
9:22
And, you know, if I have a periodic potential, I would have a plot of the form like here, which is equally Ikhwan.
9:26
So like a plane wave, but that's an modulated by a function you of arm, which is a periodic function of the same period as the potential.
9:32
You all would have seen this, and I guess. So.
9:41
We call this function five. The whole I state, we call it the block wave, and we often call you of the periodic part of it, the block function.
9:46
And bit of caution, different offers use different conventions.
9:56
Sometimes people quite a block away of quite the whole thing, a block function amongst collectors all over the place.
9:59
Key thing is that if you have the full thing, it's an iron basis, it's an iron basis, because if I choose a different quasi momentum cube,
10:05
we're talking about what is this that it would get because of this term, I get no formal function.
10:12
The two of us do not necessarily need to be a lot for excuse.
10:17
OK. So because we have a band structure will have like a band index and disappear,
10:22
and we'll talk about quantum cue and momentum, and we'll discuss in a minute why that makes sense.
10:28
So just to like, make the connexion again, to connect metaphysics was very important,
10:38
one is metaphysics is, of course, the reciprocal letters vectors which you can get in.
10:43
One is just to pay over with these two letters constant. And in our case, is lambda over two.
10:47
So over two here we cannot shift a pie from the two pie to here.
10:53
And then we say to pay over lambda, that's just K to convict of light.
10:57
So we see that the reciprocal letters vector is just two times K. Two times two photons,
11:01
the photon wave vector and definitely momentum space picture the reciprocal letters momentum HBK is to say
11:07
to a million times that's the natural scale for like the reciprocal letters vectors in an optical lattice.
11:15
There's a nice intuition where we have a talk here, and that intuition comes from thinking about all of this momentum space.
11:22
But I think this intuition is very important, so I want to spend a little bit of time on that one.
11:28
So if I think of an optical lattice in momentum space, let me start by thinking of an atom in the ground state with some weird space momentum.
11:32
And then I have two laser beams coming with Kate and. Now if you would absorb a potent from the one beam,
11:41
it would go into the excited state and have momentum plus parking because it absorbed this photons momentum.
11:47
And if then the excited state, which was stimulated emission going back to the state but emits the photon into the other beam,
11:53
which has we went to minus K, it would end up back into it ferment and p plus two h HBK.
12:01
OK. So what we basically have here, we have to put this, this is the mental processes to vote process of stimulated absorption from one beam,
12:08
followed by stimulated emission into the other beam and that changes the items were mentioned by two HBK.
12:17
So that's the fundamental process. When you think about what happens with an atom in these laser fields.
12:22
Good momentum space. And it's a very neat way of thinking about optical letters starting from momentum space and think about the momentum space.
12:28
And then later on ask What does this mean in build space?
12:36
It's kind of different from where you do things in this matter, you always start with limited space and you say it's periodic and we need space,
12:39
and then only later on you say, OK before we transform it, this is my picture momentum space.
12:46
So here you have this very neat interpretation directing momentum space to kick, start get.
12:50
For this to work, it requires coherence between the two beams because it's a coherent 240Nm process,
12:57
which basically means that the two beams have more or less the same frequency. In order to suppress single photon absorption,
13:02
so we don't want an atom to really go into this excited state and then do a spontaneous emission and go somewhere else.
13:10
What we just do is we take large tunings, typically more than 20 metres, to just suppress them.
13:15
So we think back of what we discussed, like last like two lectures ago.
13:21
The type of potential this is the form of the type of potential case like intensity over retuning.
13:25
But these spontaneous emission rates, it's like intensity of retuning squared.
13:30
So just go for a launch tuning. More than 20 nanometres. Crank up the intensity.
13:35
Use a powerful laser and you get a nice conservative potential. And that's how it looks.
13:39
Momentum space. So I'm thinking about a diaper trip. I only get a light shift from a 240mm process way of absorb.
13:43
On here and back into this, because that theme is excellent and this kind of 240Nm loop going up and coming
13:50
back down gives me just a facelift that just gives me like my excuse me,
13:56
my optical diaper potential and to the letters.
14:01
The light field is not homogeneous, and that means I have two components in it in the case base,
14:06
and therefore I can also shuffle photons from the one beam into the air and thereby change the atomic atom's momentum by to.
14:10
OK. So. This is the intuition and building on this intuition,
14:19
we can do the calculations and the calculations are typically done numerically and they're actually done relatively straightforward.
14:25
You would see the calculation you would do that on the first problem set, which will go online later today.
14:30
So the way what you do is you say, well, OK, if I start with some momentum, initially,
14:36
that only does create a momentum movement of the form, plus other times to make where there's an integer can be reached.
14:40
What I say, I start with this momentum, but I can only do like jumps of 2H bucket.
14:48
So we're going to go to a few discrete points here and a few discrete points do.
14:52
What this means is that, OK, first of all, it means that momentum is now not conserved because just changes momentum,
14:56
so momentum is not a good quantum number anymore. However, the momentum modulo two HBK is conserved because you only have this discrete steps,
15:03
and that is why we later on have this quasi momentum cue, which is exactly just the momentum.
15:12
What do you do to HBK? With just to momentum projected back into the first pre-Euros or to make the connexion of clients matter again?
15:18
We come on the next slide. If you have this structure, we have these two discrete things that basically you can write on your Hamiltonian as a matrix.
15:24
You can say what is the energy of a particle for a given L, so with this extra momentum, it's just the kinetic energy.
15:34
And you have the process of scattering one photon from here to here, which changes oh by one.
15:40
So you get a matrix, which has like a diagonal form.
15:45
We have the kinetic energies on the diagonal and like some coupling terms on the first of the elements and zero everywhere else.
15:48
And that's the matrix that you would set up, and you would see some guidance on how to do this step by step on the problem said it's easy.
15:55
And then you have this matrix and you can diagonals this number with. Or what not?
16:01
And in principle, you would say, well, I can't do this because Al is an entity, so it's infinitely big.
16:08
But it turns out in practise it's easy to truncate this, for instance, with like being less than 10.
16:13
That's typically sufficient for the lowest two bands because the order.
16:19
But this is L I have a kinetic energy which goes like a squared is 100 times higher than for the first order.
16:23
So these things are high energy and therefore. You would see this in the problems of.
16:29
So this is a way of doing it. And if you do this, then you just like calculate the states for everybody and you get floods like this.
16:34
So this is the band structure of an optical let us calculate an American. And let's start by looking at this plot up here.
16:42
We're not equals zero, you recall. Which basically means there was no lettuce.
16:48
This is free space we just assume are going to have to periodicity or you can think of this as a very, very, very, very weak lettuce.
16:52
Basically, the line in here, this is just, you know, the free space probe centred around momentum zero.
16:59
However, because of photo in here could scatter like.
17:05
One pair of photons, it could go to the momentum, plus two HBK.
17:09
Which basically means we have the same free space, and I also said that around two. And we have the same problem also centred around minus two, which.
17:14
So it is the same kind of discussion that you have done a couple of times and kind of metaphysics.
17:22
We are now thinking about it slightly differently because we are saying, OK, it's not the consequence of the periodicity that it must be like this.
17:27
It's we are saying it's a consequence of that. You have these discrete jumps in momentum space because of the photons.
17:33
It's the same physics. It's just a weird space picture because it's the momentum space picture.
17:39
And he will check second and see if everybody's comfortable with this picture and getting real space momentum space together cover,
17:46
it can be confusing when you think about it for the first time. But it should clear up very quickly.
17:52
Any questions? OK, then let's go on and let's say we now go from zero letter steps to a week, let's say two weeks.
18:03
Then you do the same thing that you do for like a quasi free election. You can say what?
18:16
I have this parabola here and that probability I have a weak coupling between them, which means that they are.
18:20
These two things are coupled and the crossing turns into an avoided crossing.
18:26
A couple you can see here that this parabola here is pushed down. If you have a problem, there is pushed up.
18:29
You see, that's how you get the bend and you get the bent gaps in the same way as you happen to cross if we elect one model.
18:34
You'll also have banquettes up here, but because they're are already very, very weak.
18:40
And then if you go into a deeper letters, the bank gets just get bigger, the bank gets pushed down a different bank,
18:45
it's flatter and flatter and then also the bank of up here becomes visible until the next bank becomes very clear.
18:50
And also, this banker becomes a. So this is really how you go from a week to a strong letters.
18:55
You see that how did dispersion relation forms? You've seen these cartoons and many condensed matter systems.
19:00
And they always say it's the result of a band structure calculation.
19:06
You cannot do the bounds of the calculation for yourself because it's only that one coupling to them.
19:09
It's very easy to do.
19:13
So what you see also from this picture is that the whole thing is periodic review period of two HBK, as it should be coming from the periodicity.
19:15
Mathematically speaking, if we had spaces, periodic mental space must also be periodic so we can restrict my whole description to a certain window
19:24
momentum space in which was the first zone where we say the quantum cue runs from minus K to K.
19:31
So we just consider the path from here up to here, and we know that the higher part will be periodic.
19:37
So we go from the extended zone scheme to the compact normal zone scheme that you see in the kindness metaphysics.
19:43
And the physical intuition behind this is that momentum, as I said, is not a concern, no, but momentum module to market is a concert.
19:50
No, because let this can only just change in momentum kicks.
19:57
So Q would just just be modular to educate this within here in this window is a conserved quantity.
20:01
And voila, we have a couple of waves. We have the iconic images, we have the band structure, we have everything.
20:08
Well, so far, we've only looked mostly looked at the energies. The next team will now be to look later on at the weights themselves.
20:14
First, one more thing.
20:22
What you probably pursue is always like the dispersion relation of the lowest band, and it's always normalised that it always goes from zero to one.
20:24
Of course, for a deeper let as it becomes flatter, flatter, flatter, you will zoom into it.
20:30
So we just normalise goes from zero to one. And what you can see here is you can see the change of the shape, the blue curve.
20:35
This let the step zero, so that's a prerogative, the free space. The red curve is five.
20:42
And the Black Line is 100, we go to a very, very deep letters.
20:50
And what you can see is that it takes this one very peculiar shape, which is basically just given away minus cosine pi over Cuba de Cuba.
20:53
Okay? So this is just like a cosine function with the minimum in the middle and the maximum here at plus minus plus minus K.
21:01
And at the moment, we just say we see this, we can fit it, it comes out of the band of calculation.
21:11
There is like a deep explanation of why it must be the cause and the they really get to refuse let.
21:17
Very often we do calculations when we think about stuff and kind of in cold atoms.
21:23
We talk about the so-called tight binding, which was just a regime that starts at roughly five, we call it.
21:28
It's characterised by here that we can say that it's permanent.
21:33
Lowest point is really given by this call centre and nothing else constant call centre in.
21:35
And minus two is the tunnelling. We'll get to that in a few slides when we talk about.
21:42
So what you see here is and this regime, the gap, the difference between red and blue is much, much, much bigger than the bandwidth.
21:48
So all of the physics we don't have in the lowest band and we can ignore everything up here because we say that's far away and we don't get to.
21:55
So that's not exactly a single event model like the Harvard model that we've seen in the past that we see in the first lecture.
22:03
And basically where we're now going to do this.
22:10
This the rest of them, in any part of this lecture and the next lecture is to see how can we get from all of those pictures,
22:12
we derive the Hubbard model to where we are today.
22:18
We are going to like do the how about model kinetic energy? So we're going to see this tight binding hopping term.
22:21
And the next lecture will start by looking at the interaction term that comes from and how that can be described.
22:25
And then we start looking at the phases of the of model. OK.
22:31
So let us above five, we call we say we ended up finding which we can use to type binding approximation with see that later.
22:35
And there we have this kind of dispersion relation. And we just have to like think about a single band because it's a big band.
22:42
Good next thing. NATO states the bloc, how do they look, how should I think about a plot with.
22:49
Do I have a visual way of thinking about an intuition of what the plot actually is, how it looks like?
22:57
And it turns out it is a very nice way of thinking about this, which basically comes again from this fact that,
23:03
OK, Typekit is not just I call this like a plane wave to people in space.
23:08
And we say that this one is coupled by the letter's potential only to these primes, which is plus minus two.
23:13
And they again, only coupled to that plus minus two, which came more so this.
23:19
This creates structure of the discrete plot in momentum space that we get from having only this discrete K vector and
23:22
letters that one is going to guide us because what that one is going to tell us that you can take your block with.
23:28
You can also write this as a superposition of plane waves. It can only be the plain wave of momentum que plus air times two.
23:34
Right.
23:42
So I can think of a shock wave as being a plane wave without a higher order plane waves of two four six, it became more momentum being mixed in.
23:43
And what did they need is I need to know the coefficients. How much of each plane wave is in a given block with?
23:53
And those coefficients you diabetic get out of your day, analyzation of the Evertonian in the previous light.
24:00
And you can calculate the numerically very easily. And here's how they look.
24:06
So this is not a coefficient squared. So 20, the population of the different blog waves, let's start with this one is cubic with zero.
24:10
So like in the middle of the zone where the question went to the yellow and the red curfew is always the the lowest plot,
24:17
the lowest play we've the with a fundamental being just about you.
24:24
And then the blue ones is Q plus two K and the blue dashed line you only see
24:30
here is Q minus two K and then the black ones is like a Q plus minus pocket.
24:35
So what you basically series is a function of the letters that it letters to step zero by block away as I played with.
24:41
That makes sense, because if that is the zero,
24:48
basically there's no let us dare sort of block the plane are the 18 states of which basically the 18 states of a non-existing let us.
24:49
Then let us get steeper. You can see that this function comes down.
24:57
So we have less and less and less population at the clock as a plane waiting for momentum zero.
25:01
And we have like an increasing population in both the plus first and minus first or so, two plus and minus two.
25:06
So the deeper letters becomes, the more we mix those things in. And then the black line stay very, very low.
25:14
They come a little bit up here, 20 week, obviously deep letters. There's a little bit of that, but not much.
25:19
So I can basically think of my black wave just as a plain wave of a bit of an ethnic feature of the higher order terms.
25:24
And this is in the middle of the zone.
25:30
If I go half halfway to the side of the hill, also halfway between zero and one between the middle and the edge of the green zone.
25:32
Same story I get maybe a bit more decay of the current wave.
25:38
And they get now in the cemetery to they get more of the solid line versus the dashed line, which makes sense of a move like towards plus one half.
25:42
I get give you more of the minus three half compared to the plus five half because that's a lower kinetic energy.
25:49
Makes sense. And then the second order terms also slightly more important.
25:55
What I can see here, if I go very, very close to the edge of the zone, that's where, like the quasi free energy electoral model,
26:00
quasi free electron model would have said that you get like hybridisation right away because you have this crossing,
26:07
which any small coupling with between avoided crossing. You can see that you can see that very quickly jumped on from one to point five.
26:12
And like the other one, that minus first order comes off. Because I really have this point, the plastic.
26:19
It's like in resonant, the transition from plus to minus K is from a state with the same kinetic energy to the same intensity kinetic energy.
26:25
So David hybridise to a 50 50 situation very, very quickly.
26:31
It's very, very quickly, it's not instantly, because I'm not at K, I'm 99 percent OK to make the plot myself.
26:35
OK. So at Let the steps the block with almost coincide with the plane waves and the people at the steps,
26:42
the admixture of the two plus plus minus two, which make things become significant.
26:50
Good. So now we can start doing many body physics, we have no basis, we have to block waves and we can ask what will?
26:58
ABC do when a loaded into a letter. What do you think?
27:07
I haven't gone into acting like you'd be easy and I loaded into an optical lattice.
27:12
What would you think? Everybody staring at me like, nobody's thinking, OK.
27:28
So. This plot is the one that explains everything.
27:38
If I think of ABC and free space. It's like condensation into the lowest energy state, so the lowest momentum state.
27:43
So the B.C. women over macroscopic occupation of all of the particles down here at zero momentum at a minimum of two parabola.
27:49
They will now start to crank up letters.
27:57
Basically, what happens is that there's dispersion relation to parabola turns into this kind of like tight binding band into this cosine shape,
28:00
but the minimum stay zero zero.
28:07
So basically the only thing that happens is that the plane wave in which all of the atoms have condensed into it slowly turn into a block wave,
28:10
which basically means that all of the atoms now get an admixture of this plus minus two HBK peaks and nothing else.
28:16
I still have a b c. It's no it's still a condensation in the state of lowest kinetic energy.
28:22
It's just that that state is another plane wave, but a block with. And that's how I can describe this, b c a t zero non interacting.
28:27
It's condensation that quick with zero. So basically, if I have an atoms.
28:37
I put all of those atoms in the shock wave and lower spent with momentum zero.
28:41
And in second quantum notation, I write this data saying I start with the vacuum state and then they act with the operator a not zero,
28:47
which kind of like is to create an operator for goes on in this block with.
28:53
And because we're only talking about law spent now and then,
28:58
if I have a particle to operate with this one and eight times to put in a particles in that busy way function.
29:01
And then I have to put this picture in front of it for normalisation.
29:08
OK, so that's a standard second quarter annotation that you probably have seen in previous lectures.
29:13
OK. So how can I check with what is really happening, how can I see this in the picture?
29:20
And the answer is I just use time of like picture again. Time of flight pictures, imaging, we talked about, I think, last.
29:27
Last lecture or last week,
29:34
and we said that basically what you get is you get to see the velocity distribution and momentum distribution of the particles in free space.
29:36
So what you now, you know, in the letters, you know, his face. So what you have to do to is not time of flight.
29:42
You know, the only switch of your travel to tell the whole thing together. You also instantly switch off your letters.
29:48
And you can think about what happens if I instantly switch off my letters.
29:54
Well, I take these states that I have and I suddenly project them to the states of the new Hamiltonian.
29:57
So I take my block waves refugee each block wave onto plane waves.
30:03
So if I have a block where if that consisted of different plane waves,
30:07
diagnose the state that the estimates are would be it would be a superposition of those plane with and each of
30:11
those being raised would of course move according to its own velocity and would separate out the time of flight.
30:15
And again, we will only get like this discrete classes of momentum, because only this these classes of fermenter are part of the block with.
30:21
So basically, the picture is in momentum space. I have a ABC, so everything is occupying one quarter momentum.
30:30
With zero Typekit. And then there's a time of flight and then look at the weird space momentum that I get after time of night.
30:37
I would expect a series of sharp peaks. PB, q q minus two K minus four K plus two K plus 4K.
30:43
And indeed, this is one of the most famous experiments and code items ever done, it was done basically 20 years ago.
30:51
But it said, OK, let's take time off like pictures of ABC loaded into an optical lattice as a function of the latter steps.
31:00
So this has led us to zero. We just have a busy time of night, you get your sharp central peak.
31:06
There is no time component to you because they have pretty close to zero.
31:12
And then say no increased let us state and for good purposes, it's not done in one day.
31:15
It's done over two letters. But the same it happens in the x direction also happens in the right direction.
31:20
So it's the same kind of physics. You can see the satellite peaks, your period.
31:25
So those are the peaks at like +2 h back plus minus two in the direction of the same thing in the right direction.
31:29
And now if you if you look at them further. If you look at them forever,
31:35
if you increase your letters that were associated with letters that these satellite picks get stronger and stronger and stronger.
31:39
So you can now also see, like a second order piece appearing here,
31:46
which are like atoms that are excited both to HBK and the extent to which became the right direction.
31:49
They also exist here. They're just so weak that you don't see them.
31:55
So it's exactly the picture to be said that the deeper my letters becomes, the stronger the ethics of this high up waste becomes.
31:58
And I can see this as the satellite pics coming up. And if you have the results of your calculation, you can say, OK,
32:05
that the population that you see is directly proportional to the CO2 create the coefficient of the block wave that you've calculated.
32:13
OK, so that's what we have, we have these very sharpies. And there is now a different way of thinking about this.
32:21
We have long time of flight, I said before that when you have long term flight,
32:29
you kind of look at momentum space and that's a little bit like thinking about Fraunhofer refraction and optics.
32:32
So another way of thinking about this, and this is confusing you, but helping you.
32:39
Another way of thinking about this is by thinking about this as the interference of weight. You have little metre wave starting on each letter site.
32:44
They are spread out, become big, they all overlap and they will all interfere.
32:51
And because these methods are all coherent, they all come from the same B.S., they have the same face at each point in the BBC.
32:55
Originally we have this long range face coherence, the off the air and long range order we discussed last time.
33:01
That means that it's basically like a multi slit in the formula.
33:07
Like I said, creating havoc, creating with many, many slits, and they all do the same laser light, so to speak,
33:10
and therefore you get when you look far away and the Fraunhofer limit you get like differential diffraction pattern.
33:16
And the front of reflection pattern is exactly a series of sharp peaks, but it.
33:22
But just what exactly is given by the victor of your underlying crit? So you momentum space.
33:27
It's a time of long time flight is the same as front of refraction.
33:34
And the fact that you start with the ABC is to say many slits illuminated with a coherent light.
33:37
These are all different pictures, the old saying, OK, I can look look at these effects,
33:49
the momentum space, this custom there or I can look at them in real space, dictate this custom there.
33:52
And it's a mental.
33:56
Important mental part to get those picture together that you're kind of comfortable saying, OK, this happens and we it's based is the same thing.
33:58
Just see the momentum space. The second important part, because then you get very versatile later on and saying, OK, well,
34:05
this aspect is easy to understand if we embrace this aspect is easy to understand momentum space.
34:11
If you go back and forth as you need. OK.
34:15
Another thing is what happens if I don't have a B.S.,
34:21
if I say have a former state run into any political committee, much smarter than the bank, so the only the spent?
34:24
Well, what we expect is that when you think about the quality of distribution, you expect that you don't have to be code zero.
34:31
But you expect that if your temperature is above the critical temperature, you expect that this broadens up and looks like a little caution.
34:37
And then if it gets much hotter, it gets even hotter.
34:45
And then it's not perfectly gostin anymore,
34:49
but look slightly different because the underlying dispersion relation is not not just a private island, it's a coastline.
34:51
So therefore it looks different, but it's the same statistical physics principles and how I occupy those.
34:56
And if he knows what time of flight?
35:01
The particle in each of those plot waves would still undergo the same kind of projection onto all of the plane waves as it does,
35:04
which basically means they get copies of this brought up in the middle of all of the other points.
35:10
OK. So that's how I can think about this. So the sharpness of the peaks that I get.
35:17
In this time of flight picture really tells me something about the coherence length of the method after the heavens let us.
35:23
In the same way as when you do the friction experiment in optics, you do thermal light,
35:30
sources say if there's a finite coherence length in the light source, I will only see a certain sharpness of the peaks.
35:34
The sharper the peaks, the longer coherence length I must have.
35:41
Which is ultimately just a principle, if millimetre wave is quietly spread out over a large distance that the X is very big,
35:45
then the momentum space can be very small.
35:52
It's always wave mechanics going back and forth between momentum and furious based momentum, and we need spaces always in the end just to.
35:56
OK, so this is going to be important intuition.
36:04
We are going to calculate how such a picture will look of interference term and all of that and to lectures from now.
36:07
So we get a bit more quantitative. But I wanted to start with a quantitative intuition because then it's easy to follow the calculation.
36:13
OK. Now we have a nice basis, we can discuss a lot of the stuff that we want to discuss in momentum space using the block waves.
36:22
All looking very, very good. Let's do something more, let's take a different basis.
36:32
Let's talk about a one year basis.
36:37
Why do we need have a basis if we take if you have to deduct bases is often inconvenient because it's bases momentum space.
36:39
If I have interactions between the particles which will come next lecture, they're typically local contact interactions.
36:48
So they're easy to describe in real space particles interact with, they're close to each other and those are too far away from each other.
36:53
Describing this momentum, space would be pretty hot. So it's easy to describe this momentum space.
36:59
Also, we have to think about a trap. Say our back is not infinitely big, but it lifts up.
37:03
The tiny trap is a structure and we'll space again. Very hard to describe.
37:10
Harder to describe momentum space. So it's very important for us to have a basis where we can describe all of the physics.
37:14
In real space, instead of a momentum space and that base, this is going to be the one year basis.
37:20
With her about one year functions before. I hope most people would have.
37:25
OK, so what is the venue function? And a simple mathematical level, I would say I take the plot waves of a given band and they do a Fourier transform.
37:31
It's a discreet for it and so on, because we have a finite sized system and give it is critical as we went to India.
37:43
If I take an infinitely big system, it will be the integral of a.
37:48
And by doing that, I get a new function of free transform function, which is the value function.
37:53
And when you think about what happens when you normally do this, when you normally say, OK,
37:58
let me take a plane wave and truly transform it to fruition, some of that one is delta.
38:03
Might as low as it can be in frequency space, so it can do the opposite?
38:09
OK, let me take something that's like very pretty localised, like a plane wave in momentum space.
38:13
And then the transom of that is like a delta where you can read space. What you do in fit view is that gives you like the the field apparatus.
38:18
What we're doing here is, no, we're saying, OK, we want to do the same thing,
38:26
but we don't want to end up with like a database's because we don't want to like have to little particles.
38:30
It's localised to a point.
38:34
We want to have the particles localised to something with pre-order a letter site and we want them to still be in the lowest band.
38:36
So in some sense of a make a cartoon, you. If.
38:43
Not. This is my lettuce potential.
38:48
If you take all of the plane weights or all of the weights and all of the bands together, and you fruit transformed and you get a delta function.
38:53
But this function would be very, very sharp. We have very high kinetic energy, so it wouldn't be so sharp.
39:01
So that's not a good model for describing the low energy physics because the low energy physics only lives in the lowest bend.
39:06
So whatever what you want is, you want that function that lives mostly on this little side.
39:13
And that function is just confined out of the lowest point. So what you do is now you say, OK, I think in the event structure,
39:19
I have my band some event gaps and I think all of the ways that we have available in the lowest band.
39:26
So all of the plot ways for a given index in a given band.
39:31
And then it will fully transform just of those. But then I get the most localised function that it can build out of the block waves in one single bit.
39:36
So they asked what positions of the blocks in a given bed.
39:45
So you see, they carry an index and they have the value function for the first event of any function for the second parent and so on.
39:48
We typically amidst the end and just think about the lowest point, but that's the structure.
39:54
And the value function. W end of set minus that is localised on the latter side that I.
39:58
So it's like always a superposition of all of those plane waves, but the face factors depend on which side I choose.
40:06
And definitely is constructive interference. I wrote this letter side by side at the site.
40:12
And it's just in the phases, because, of course, if the latter has a discrete translation and variance that every letter site looks the same,
40:18
the venue functions must look the same on every site to just. OK.
40:25
So does it have on your conscience? They form an awful on the basis of the food single particle, but space.
40:30
And that's maybe like a conceptual thing. Normally when you have free space, you would say all plane ways to cover a few bases of all but space,
40:36
it is quite possible state a single particle can be. Going from the plane race to the block waves is a basis transformation,
40:42
which means all plot waves, all bands together also form like a full hip space.
40:51
You can discuss anything you want to express, any state you want and all of the plot with all the ends taken together.
40:55
And then if you take like blocks out of this, each bend individually, transform, bend each bend individually to form,
41:01
plus it's to one you states you can get off a normal basis, which you can use to discuss everything you do with space places.
41:07
Looks fine, if you take all of these bands together, you can take all of the plot,
41:15
all of the funniest states on the Givealittle side and make a data function out of them.
41:19
Sum of all of the bad.
41:23
However, you can also say that we only take care of the lowest band because that's where the physics lifts that I'm interested in.
41:24
And then you get like this one year basis and it's very convenient basis to.
41:30
Just for the experts, we're looking for a dynamic limit to some turns to an asset that's already.
41:37
You will hear a lot talk about gauged choices and gauge what the optimal choices like most function, what this means is that.
41:43
If ever if ever a block away from you in. I can multiply that by face, I fire.
41:54
And it's a block away, if it's still a solution of the same, I have to say, remember Tony, you have to say Michael Energy.
42:00
So even I choose different face factors do different ways, and everyone who functions in this vote on transform that are more or less well organised.
42:06
So in the high dimensional system, if you want to do this once inside a triangle,
42:14
you have to take the white gaze choice, which means the right choice of. Face facts with different block weights in order to get.
42:17
The most lucrative new functions that you can. We do the calculations only in one day, we don't care.
42:25
We do care, but it's easy because if you just take all of the ways to be real, that's an optimal choice of body.
42:31
So it's easy for us just saying, if you ever run across this in like high dimension, let us be warned.
42:37
So here today, look, if I take a block away, if I can transform easily, numerically.
42:45
And this is what I get, what we have here is and create letters potential again for different letters,
42:49
steps and the value functions are plotted in blue and the resulting density of any function that they just create is in red.
42:55
So what you see is kind of interesting, you see if I go for very deep letters.
43:04
Like this one, because I can basically kind of approximate the lowest part of this, let aside as an harmonic oscillator.
43:09
And then, you know, what can I say? It looks like it would just be a. But how many goes across the.
43:16
And indeed, if you look at the density distribution here, it's basically just like a single garden and nothing special to it.
43:21
You see, it's a perfectly caution because it has a little bit of a WinCo on the next letter size, but that's pretty small if you just look at the.
43:29
If you just look at the density, what's kind of interesting is that if you go for a weekend that is five we call or three we call,
43:37
you see that this week on the neighbouring sites, they become bigger. It becomes significant.
43:44
And one places, you see, it's actually pretty oscillating function.
43:48
It's the localised and one letter site, but it has quite a significant site lobes on neighbouring sites.
43:51
And this site looks are important. I can approximate my value function with a caution for very deep, let us be careful because.
43:57
Even though the overlap between the cost of the value function is very,
44:07
very high because say the point is that the value functions by definition are often normal functioning of normal basis,
44:10
where the different positions are not often orthogonal to each other.
44:18
But it's an important distance difference and the fact that I have this kind of little negative things here on the side and the side loops.
44:22
That's exactly what makes them what makes them orthogonal foreigner because they gives seem like a positive contribution and a negative contribution,
44:27
which then cancels the overlap overlapping.
44:33
If the elections would adjust positive, then you just have to modify two positive numbers at every point and integrate over that.
44:35
You can never get to zero because you never have anything negative to compensate the positive parts.
44:42
So we need functions that also we get negative.
44:46
And the second thing is important that if I take this as an approximation here and I use that to calculate the tunnelling elements.
44:50
They are typically massive. So even though the value of the function itself is correct to 99 percent,
44:59
the tunnelling elements that get out of it are off by a factor of 10 or more. So a lot of like.
45:06
Analytical papers in the past 10, 15 years ago or 20 years ago, they said, OK,
45:12
let's try to do everything analytical and try to like, take some approximations to make things simple.
45:19
And they took this course an approximation, for instance, quality of new functions.
45:23
And then they got totally off results because it's a good approximation, you are just care about the shape.
45:27
But it is a very bad approximation of I care about the tunnelling element. So therefore, if you want to, like,
45:32
know the tunnelling elements where real the way we do it is that we really have to assimilate these fancy functions correctly.
45:36
So if we now have a new basis. We can, of course, express the Hamiltonians in this new basis.
45:43
We now have two spaces of one of functions where the letters, the state, I mean, that is the it's a it's a wave function centred on site.
45:48
I often let us. The letter cites member Tony will always be like 100 100 Matrix and the seven Tony will have two elements.
45:56
Two types of elements would have diagonal elements y equals G defined components of the material and bits of the onside energy.
46:04
What is the energy of an ATM on site living on site, and then it would have like off elements, right?
46:11
And that's going to be the tunnelling tunnelling from one side to another. The overlap between those two things.
46:20
So the site energy Epsilon, I is constant and homogeneous letters from homogeneous means discrete translations,
46:26
symmetry of it at the site looks the same. So it got to be a constant. So it's often omitted.
46:34
But sometimes you need it when you have a trip or something you needed at the tunnelling element.
46:39
You can calculate you can just say, OK, it's the expectation value of money,
46:44
a function of this site, Hamiltonian in the middle of your function, and that's integral over it.
46:48
You would do in America because you have your value functions only numerically, but it could be taken away for you and you get this tumbling matrix.
46:53
Again, if I have an homogeneous letters, the tunnelling elements must also be homogeneous, which means T depends freely on what I is and what it is.
47:04
It can only depend on the distance I minus G or hopping one to the left or two to the right.
47:14
That would be different, but if I hop from here to here or from here to here must be the same if that this is homogeneous.
47:19
And then. We can do the same thing that you do in kindness, metaphysics, we say, to start to think about the type binding limit,
47:27
the tight binding approximation basically means that I say all of those tunnelling elements are zero, except for the nearest neighbours.
47:33
So this is pretty deep.
47:41
I will have a tunnelling from one side to the neighbouring site, but tunnelling to further sites would be very, very, very small.
47:43
And it turns out that if you write down you Hamiltonian in this tight binding limit.
47:50
In the one year basis.
47:54
So I say I have a set of letter sites that I can only tell from one side to the neighbouring site for one side to the neighbouring site.
47:56
If you take this and you analyse this, you ask where the identities of the system.
48:02
You get exactly a cosine shaped dispersion relation. So once you tight binding, the dispersion relation must be a cause.
48:08
So therefore, what people do in practise is they look at their dispersion relation. Say how much closer does it look?
48:15
If it looks like a perfect cosine, genotype binding approximation would be good.
48:21
If it looks very different from a cosine, then it cannot yet be in type binding that will have to consider longer range hopping and so on.
48:25
OK. Oh, yeah, and these tunnel links, they are in the kind which are people typically call them for tunnelling and code literature.
48:33
Very often it's called for tunnelling j because you need something and T is taken for time, so we just don't have enough letters.
48:44
So you see, sometimes Taiwan, sometimes T, sometimes j, it's always the same thing.
48:52
It's the nearest neighbour tunnelling into that binding model.
48:56
Right, and here's now what it looks like. This is just a numerical calculation.
49:01
If I take the nearest neighbour tunnelling from a any functions, that's the proper line down here.
49:06
And you see that it decreases swiftly if I go from a three week old letters to letters.
49:12
You see that the next nearest neighbour tunnelling, so two letter sites further away is the yellow line, which is sizeable of over very weak letters.
49:17
But at around five, we call it becomes put it towards a small fraction of the purple one.
49:25
And then you see the next two next to nearest neighbour of three sides is pretty small over here, and it's totally reachable up there.
49:30
So what you see from this is that about five we call you can collect the yellow part and you can say, well, it's all just the nearest neighbour to.
49:37
And. The dispersion relation, as you would have done in tight binding limit, went ahead, the form of minus 20.
49:47
Cosine. Pie. Q, Okay.
49:56
And this minus 20 means, of course, that the coastline can go from minus one to one means that the bandwidth of a tight binding band the bandwidth.
50:02
Should be 14. So if you if you write down your Evertonian, you in the value basis, you diagonals,
50:12
look at the ideologies they go from minus two to two plus to 40 years to bentworth.
50:19
And. If I now plot in blue here, just a band of the lowest band from the band structure,
50:24
I'm sorry, the band to the lowest from the band structure divided by four.
50:32
So what would be the tunnelling that I ever just like? Take the whip of the band and divide it by four?
50:37
What would be the prediction for the tunnelling? I get the blue line. You see the blue line at the proper line up here dislikes more differences.
50:41
But starting from, say, here, they perfectly overlap. So is the dispersion relation that really is justified by person.
50:47
So all of these things hang together, and we have a very good description of them.
50:55
And what's annoying for purists is that because of dispersion relations are cosine and not just a parabola.
50:59
Many of the tweaks quotient equation and so on that you would normally use in free
51:06
space to do analytic calculations don't work because it's cosine and not x squared.
51:10
Which means that very many things you can't do really, really good analytical theory, you have to go to numerical models.
51:15
But even to get the band structure correctly. You've got to get to get this numerical simulation.
51:22
If you want to like look this up and quite a lot more detail on what happens really on the mathematical side.
51:28
This is called the Morphew equation before us, but your differential equations,
51:34
you can see it as a tons and tons of mathematical literature about what you can do in a particular and for it.
51:38
So there's a lot that can be done. We tend to not cooperate just with numerically.
51:45
And then once you have this curve, you have everything that you need to know. OK.
51:48
So the fact that now. This one becomes exponentially suppressed,
51:53
almost four different that means that we can play with a lot of things we can, for instance, play with dimensionality.
51:59
We can, for instance, say if we take a three dimensional letters and make all of the three directions very deep,
52:05
then you can think of this as something where you don't have tunnelling and you really have like a three dimensional array of isolated sites.
52:11
If you put one particle there, it's pretty boring.
52:17
But if you put two particles on there, you can start to play with them into molecules and do funny things with them.
52:19
Not so much a quantum simulation, but for other things like precision molecular physics.
52:25
Where we very often do is we say, OK, let's take two lettuces very deep. But let's have one, let us direction this direction, the weaker that is.
52:30
Because then what you get is you get like a lot of hopping in this direction and almost no hopping between these things.
52:37
So this is what we call one dimensional systems where you have these one dimensional
52:42
tubes and you get like the physics of one dimensional along this direction.
52:45
And because you're really in the lowest band of letters, you really only have one state on each of the letter sites.
52:49
And if you really perfectly in the one situation, if you don't have to bother with transverse exhortations.
52:56
You cannot lower, too, and you got a system or you cannot lower all three and you get like a few kinematic in 3D system.
53:02
So there's a lot of playing with the mentioned that it is coming from this. OK.
53:08
And. Even I just write down this type binding Hamiltonian in second quantised form, and we'll look at this again next week.
53:13
You know what? Let me stop here and before I rush to this and we do it again next week, anyway.
53:23
Let me stop here and have this last slide. Coming up next week.
53:28
OK. Any questions up to you? Or.
53:33
Mm hmm. Mm-Hmm. Shouldn't all the.
53:42
Good. That's a good question.
53:58
I would have to. Oh, yes, OK. Because. Not all of these tunnelling can be must be positive.
54:09
Sometimes things can be negative,
54:17
so they say I got like the minimum energy you want to have staggered phases plus minus plus minus plus minus plus minus.
54:18
And that means that you cannot maximise all of those terms at the same time.
54:23
But if you want to have the positive energy case or the lowest possible energy for the for the nearest neighbour tunnelling,
54:26
you have the same face everywhere.
54:33
But that means that in the contribution that you get from the second term, if it's if it's negative, it's the opposite side will be of the other side.
54:35
So that means it's not just adding a positive number, a positive and negative numbers, and that gets us to the effect.
54:42
OK. So what we will do this afternoon is we will update will upload the first problem set
54:51
with an idea that the first problem set will then be handed in sometime next week.
54:59
And we will also then take the time to like send an email to everybody who is registered to like register for like the supervision groups.
55:04
So if you want to take us for reasons that you're not yet registered for, this cause us do it now because we need to email this this afternoon.
55:12
OK, thank you all. See you on Tuesday.
55:20
