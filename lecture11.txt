Let's get started with lecturer 11 second to last lecture.
0:00
So quickly, we view some things about feminisation just for five minutes or two minutes
0:05
to then talk for like ten minutes about something that is not feminisation,
0:10
namely localisation and then go on to start with, like the last big topic of the course, namely artificial gauge fields and topology.
0:13
OK, so we said last time we said that closed quantum systems cannot verbalise because the shooting at question is in any equation.
0:21
However, we also said that they do verbalise where we mean something slightly different to formalisation.
0:31
And we said that we know that this huge big wave function of the many buddy system of its thoughts as a pure state will always remain a pure state,
0:36
so it cannot Clovelly fully relax into a state and a unitary time evolution.
0:42
It's different when you have an open system, of course, but if the system is closed, that cannot happen.
0:46
But we said that that's actually interesting intellectually,
0:51
but it's not of not much practical consequences because all of the things that
0:55
we can measure that we can look at will look exactly like a further system.
0:59
And the answer is the eye can see the feminisation hypothesis that basically
1:02
says all of these many Asian states will by themselves look like failed states.
1:06
And it's just that if you have specific superpositions of those as your initial states, they look non-formal.
1:11
So the example is, if I have like a state left plus right and left minus right,
1:16
then if I take the position of the two, I can create a state that's only left. So that describes the the that start in the left hand side.
1:20
But I would say that it would spread out over the whole system, of course,
1:27
if it can, and I can see that providing states or would you take it into account? So this proposition initially makes stuff look non-formal.
1:30
The coherence is in the initial state and then we can the finger of feminisation just as a defacing between
1:36
all of those many body eigen states such that when there is no coherence left in the firm in the long term,
1:41
limit or coherence is a so chaotic that we can't really see them anymore.
1:46
Then you end up with just like a mixture of these kind of a looking eigen states and you get to confirm a lot of the.
1:51
And we saw how powerful this is by saying you can take a complex,
1:56
two dimensional quantum system and let it expand so you can do something where you have like a quantum problem,
1:59
it's numerically absolutely intractable, but where we can say that if we assume that the system locally formalises.
2:04
And then we just got a slow classical evolution that's driven by gradients, temperature,
2:11
chemical potential, so we get hydrodynamics spaghetti fusion equations and so on,
2:16
then we can actually take like a classical Boltzmann approach and calculate 15 minutes on a mobile phone,
2:20
even what you would expect if we get something that looks pretty OK. Forget, by the way, everything happening here it below zero.
2:26
This is like technical artefacts from the specific way the experiment was done.
2:33
We also said that in 2D. Classically speaking, you would expect the 2D system is chaotic and verbalising,
2:38
but to guess what you would expect it, the one D system like the Newton's Cradle can be an integral system.
2:44
So it has so many kinds quantities, so many intricacies of motion that it cannot families, allies and it therefore shows a very different.
2:50
Regular dynamics.
2:58
It's a little bit like, like many things, when you say, OK, if I have like regular dynamics, it's typically a consequence of I have only one,
3:01
then then mechanically or freedom left because everything else is covered by the court of motion.
3:07
Like, if you have like a planet orbiting the Sun,
3:11
you have energy and you have Anglo momentum being conserved and therefore the only thing that you can do the only orbit,
3:13
which is the regular orbit that is compatible with these to conserve quantities.
3:19
So the idea is to have enough conserved quantities to get myself regular. Otherwise, I would be chaotic and feminising.
3:22
So if you look at this, the quantum system, you could also see that the treaty systems is the blue line here was really the assuring I.
3:29
So it was showing that if the system is interacting, you get very, very slow.
3:36
Diffusive dynamics of the particles almost cannot move because they're colliding all the
3:40
time with the other particles and forgetting the memory for getting their initial momentum,
3:44
and therefore they never get far. You have a very small diffusion concept where we said that in one day the system is different because the
3:48
system is integral and you get a fast ballistic expansion just showing you as an example of these differences.
3:54
And this kind of like into cable systems, they are, of course, integral to systems, they are finely tuned.
4:01
You have to make sure they all have the same authority exactly one otherwise you lose.
4:08
The conserve quantities of the whole system will turn chaotic and verbalising.
4:13
So in the many very sense, being into quibble seems to be like a very special point,
4:17
a very special fragile point that you add anything generic to the Hamiltonian,
4:21
even if it's small, it would kill that effect and trying to diffuse it again.
4:25
However, the question is, is there also a robust alternative to formalisation to systems always when the generic want to formalise?
4:30
Or can there be like more general thousands of exceptions where a system does not? One does not verbalise even in the long run.
4:38
And the answer is localisation. And this is a way of localisation that was predicted by Andersen and explained away in 1958.
4:44
And the story is that a single particle the this sort potentially can become localised by the disorder.
4:52
It's called Anderson localisation. And this is a wave effect. Is this not the classical localisation?
4:56
I mean, there's a classical effect as the classical effect to say, if I take a bowl and I put it down in this lowest deli,
5:02
then the pub, which does not have the energy to overcome any of the barriers. So it's stuck in that valley forever.
5:07
This is not what we're talking about. We're talking about what's the classical limit?
5:12
If you wanted to quantum effect this more subtle, the quantum effect is saying What think about what you didn't want the quantum mechanics.
5:16
Think about a step in the potential and think about a quantum wave coming in.
5:23
Then you know, what happens at the step is that some part of the wave function will be transmitted
5:28
in some part of the way function will be reflected right that you can calculate it.
5:32
And now the next step is conceptually rather simple, but has surprising consequences.
5:37
Let's just say I have like many steps and steps up and steps down.
5:42
And because we just ordered these happen at random positions. So at random positions, I have to step up or step down.
5:47
And then you can calculate, of course, what happens at every step you can always say, OK, what is the wave function coming in?
5:55
Some part gets reflected, some part gets transmitted. And that's that.
5:59
The story is now that if you want to ask how much of this comes out at the right end, then you would say,
6:05
Well, I have to take all of those empty tweets coming from all of those multiple reflections,
6:09
all of those past where I say, OK, I got straight through or I got reflected here and reflected there and go out where I got reflected here,
6:12
then reflected there again and go out. I have to take the sum of all of those possibilities of of those amplitudes and
6:20
because the positions of these steps up and step stones are considered to be random.
6:27
Well, what I get is I get many, many empty tweets here and they will all have random phases.
6:32
And if I have known how many complex numbers we've run in phases, they will average down to zero.
6:37
Which basically means that this random the potential step up and step down will
6:43
localise the particles to the particles will not be able to get to the right hand side.
6:47
And for this argument, we only said that you get, like some part of the wave function, be reflected and being transmitted.
6:53
We did not say how much of it. So even if these steps are arbitrarily small.
6:58
You always get like whatever, one per mile of the wave function being reflected or one to 10 to the minus five being reflected at each step.
7:04
But if you have enough steps, say tentative five steps. Still, the argument holds and you will not get anything through here.
7:10
So what this means, Anderson showed this mathematically, is that in one dimension,
7:17
arbitrarily small or localised, all of the EIGEN states it all of the energies.
7:21
Because even if your potential is very, very small, the effect is weak in the sense that you get only little of the wave function being reflected.
7:27
But then if you just make the sum of more and more and more terms, at some point you get back to like everything being localised.
7:34
So it's a quantum mechanical interference effect.
7:40
It's not like the classical ball just being trapped in the lowest minimum, it's an effect of the wave scattering all the time.
7:42
But all of those steps and things in the potential. OK.
7:47
So this was known since the 50s, and this is, of course,
7:53
the single political effect because we're just not talking about the way function of a single particle so far.
7:55
Yes, it's the very funny stuff. It's just pointed at the biggest paper.
8:00
Yeah. Oh yeah. OK. So I mean, this is not just a simple example, but all of the steps up in September are the same.
8:04
Yes, I mean, the same argument that I made here also happens.
8:10
You read it. Every of these little wiggles, some part of the way fans would be reflected, some would be transmitted.
8:14
The argument is the same. Yes. OK.
8:20
So the question then is and that was a question, it was debated for a long, long time or is still debated.
8:26
Does this localisation so wife and interacting system at finite energy?
8:31
And like many people, when it first, and that's not when you opened up the possibility in the first paper and said,
8:37
this will this needs to be looked at could be possible. For decades, people were pretty convinced that, no, this cannot survive.
8:42
And one of the arguments they gave was an argument that comes from like a spectroscopy where there was something called conditionally phasing.
8:48
The fact is that, OK, I have this kind of a complicated path that my particle takes.
8:55
But if the particle on the time collides with another particle that gives you a random Faceshift.
8:59
So that kind of kills the coherence. So they would say, well,
9:03
lot of interference terms might go away if you have collisions in the system
9:08
and that turns any coherent quantum evolution into diffusive slower dynamics.
9:10
It's an argument. Another argument was to say, well, if I think about I can also think about this localisation in terms of resonances,
9:17
I can say there's little orbital here and other orbital there,
9:23
and I can't really hop from here to here because this little orbital will now have slightly different energies and then have energy mismatch.
9:26
And therefore I can't hop from here to there. And that's what localises me.
9:33
The same story in a different picture, in a picture of localised states, not of plane waves.
9:36
And then the argument would be to say that, well, if I have no collisions between particles,
9:41
I suddenly have an exponentially larger space to consider quite soon, as if interactions between the particles.
9:45
After that, consider not only one particle, but consider what all of the particles do to get this exponential scaling in the number of atoms.
9:51
And this exponential scaling means that space is much, much denser. Many, many, many more states, exponentially more states.
9:58
So it's much more likely they will always find the resonance. I will always find that, OK, I have to go up a little bit here.
10:03
But if another particle goes down a little bit down on the other side that they collide by doing this, total energy is the concept.
10:08
So we have much, much more freedom due.
10:14
So nonetheless, in 2005, two big papers, this is one of them came out that on the theory side said that actually,
10:16
if you do the vation fury and we sum this to all orders the court,
10:24
surely you could sum it up of all of the infinite orders it chose from anybody localisation.
10:28
So it shows that you have a localised face even in the presence of interactions.
10:32
And this one dimensional systems. And then there have been many, many, many experiments.
10:37
Which kind of showed this effect? And this is not something that has been happening over the last 10 years.
10:42
We have also been working on this a lot. It's one of my favourite topics because I like this fundamental idea of does everything have to formalise?
10:47
What does it not? It's very simple, but it's very deep. In some sense, the story is fundamentally still open.
10:55
Because when you want to do numerical simulations, you can only do numerical simulations of small systems.
11:03
If you go for very big systems at some point,
11:07
there's so much entanglement in this system that you calculations tools like if you look at people doing this with matrix poorer states,
11:09
the emerging methods matrix with of operators, they can do maybe system size 50 or 100, and they can show that those systems do not verbalise.
11:16
But does that mean also an infinitely big system will not formalise? We don't know.
11:24
At the same point, you can say quantum simulations, that atoms, you can make a very big system, hundreds of sidelong.
11:29
Does this feminise or not? And the answer is, well, we have a finite lifetime in our system.
11:35
It's something to be discussed at the very beginning. What it's estimate the stable state atoms want to form the metal,
11:39
which means that ultimately we can only like keep the system there and to look at the
11:44
quantum dynamics over 100 hundred or a thousand or 10000 thousands of topping times.
11:47
And there is now some people that say there is indications that you have something
11:54
that something that you localisation de case on the LOC logarithm of the time.
11:57
So log of log of T.
12:04
Which means it's in effect, it's so incredibly slow that you would have to wait millions of billions and more of tunnelling times to really see it.
12:07
And that, of course, something that nobody can do.
12:13
There's also many theories that say, no, this is not true, this is an artefact of how you do your calculation.
12:16
We believe this the face is fundamentally stable, so it's still an interesting debate.
12:20
So how can we do some experiments on just how we think about this? So.
12:27
OK. Why do we care about this? Well, I already said it.
12:34
If you have the stability of this localisation and the presence of interactions, you have no negative behaviour.
12:36
So you have the potential for an awful long time dynamics. You don't have feminisation.
12:41
Statistical mechanics doesn't apply. It's a very different game. And it's, of course, also interesting for quantum computers.
12:45
Normally your big problem is you put your qubit in an environment,
12:52
there's always environment and then you hear so information will leak into the environment and just go away and go into this facility and it's lost.
12:55
But if your environment, if you qubit as many very localised, you don't get this information, spread it as information dilution.
13:03
You go into the scrambling of quantum information. Even it leaks out and little bit of would stay local.
13:09
So you have much, much more time to recover it and get it back into your cupboard. So it would also be of interest doing doing this for this purpose.
13:13
So we already said that Mbele will require perfect isolation from the environment
13:21
because everything we've been discussing with her close quantum systems.
13:25
As soon as I have like some coupling to a an environment, then of course I will.
13:28
I will get firm advice by the environment, whatever I do. So therefore, this is important.
13:33
How can we do an experiment on this? This was the first experiment actually that was done by us.
13:38
You start with disabilities techniques. You put particles only your the even that decides to put them in, even solids, your attach to empty.
13:43
And then you just like let the system evolve on the tunnelling and the hole. How about Hamiltonian?
13:50
And you just ask what happens if you time evolution is organic?
13:55
Then it's an issue of charge density wave CDW will be destroyed and you will have an average equal population and even an outside.
13:58
I say on average, because sometimes you measured one sometimes to measure the other, but it's kind of clear if you're a colleague,
14:06
if you go towards the macroeconomic policy angle into even sites on average have as much energy at the outside than they should in the long run,
14:11
not be any thing that distinguishes them. You should lose the memory about you and you should state where you started.
14:18
And even if you started off on and feminisation says you go everywhere.
14:23
So if I turn this around and I say, well,
14:29
if I see a persistent charge density way for all of the times that we can measure, then I have no negative behaviour.
14:32
And this we take as a strong indication or proof of localisation because we just don't know of any other non-organic behaviour that can occur.
14:38
And of course, the criticism is always, well, you waited a thousand times.
14:46
Maybe it's just slow and would have decayed after a million times. And that is the criticism where you have to say, Well, that's a fair criticism.
14:50
We can make theoretical arguments why it might or might not apply. But of course, we cannot measure four million tunnelling times yet.
14:56
So if you want to look at this quantitatively, you can, for instance, look at the imbalance, which is just like the contrast,
15:05
a number of atoms and even sites minus the number of atoms on all sides normalised to total at number.
15:09
And then just a detail how you do it as an experiment is that you don't really create an arbitrary potential.
15:15
You use something that's called an OK re-entry model, so you superimpose to encourage that.
15:22
So your main lattice is like a wavelength of 552 that the blue one and the red up here is like an incumbent with at a different wavelength,
15:28
which is just like a very weak modulation on what happens to the mean that is.
15:34
So if you want to create a hubot model, what is right and modulated in a sinusoidal fashion,
15:38
but in a sign of sort of special what is no is near irrational number. It has a consequence,
15:44
it has the consequence that it was very interesting that the localisation transition now does not happen at zero like
15:50
India and that some cases are said for any arbitrary weakness or everything is localised because this is not really as,
15:56
but something slightly different. It happens at a critical point. Details don't matter too much.
16:02
But the key thing is that we can now look at exotic and look than in the same experiment.
16:07
And that's great. So what you do here is this is a balance measured as a function of time.
16:13
Evolution, time go. It starts off at once a very high up here.
16:18
And then if you see if you take out of OJ zero, which means you have none of this quasi periodic meditation on it,
16:22
then this imbalance quickly shuts down to two zero oscillates around and basically zero.
16:28
So that's essentially aquatic time dynamics. If you go for Delta eight, on the other hand, so very strong of this disorder, you would say,
16:32
OK, well, basically why particles can't move much because it's too disordered. And basically, the imbalance stays at a very high value of 0.6.
16:40
So this is great, this shows us that the politics now are localised. They can't move.
16:48
And then also, you can see a tree is just on the localised side.
16:52
You can see it is localised in valence stays non-zero, but it's less big and it also you can see it as a longer dynamics going on.
16:56
Sort of settling down into the steady state takes longer all as you would expect.
17:03
And this was not interacting systems, you can see the aggressive of broken. Sorry.
17:09
Apologies for that. This was not a direct deposit, costs were there, we have A. Localisation, there is nothing new, nothing interesting.
17:19
The relevant part here is the monitoring particles. They reached a steady state you see very, very fast after, say, 10 tunnelling times.
17:28
So we could say, let's just look at, say, a factor of three longer 30 tunnelling times and just not plot what we get at Ferdinand
17:36
cuddling times as a function of the disorder strength and as a function of the directed.
17:43
And this was like the first main crawl for meal, which is basically showing that the imbalance that you get after this time is very small.
17:48
If you have low this slow down here, everything is blue, everything is aquatic and up here.
17:56
Even if I have interactions in this system with positive or attractive interactions, everything is dark red.
18:02
So stuff is localised, so we have many localisation, at least for those timescales.
18:08
Everything is slow. Everything appears to be very localised to direct observation of this effect.
18:13
What you can also see is that if you look just at these profile lines, the white lines here,
18:19
you see the decay, the non-interactive case is kind of like strongly localised down here already.
18:22
But then it just curves upwards a little bit, which means that weakened direction slightly.
18:27
Localise your system, make it harder to localise.
18:31
So this idea that interactions counteract localisation is true in this case, it shifts the critical transition upwards a little bit.
18:34
However, there is a difference when you get two very strong interactions, then you get like an increase in localisation again.
18:43
And this isn't the fact it's very similar to what you had, what we had in the transport experiments last time.
18:48
It's the effect that when you go to like the hard core limit, there's a mapping from strongly directing hard core particles back to free fermions.
18:54
So you kind of expect that this curve must come back down here. It's a reaction behaviour.
19:00
So this was actually over 20 tumbling times at that point.
19:05
And then later on, they were experiments done where this is basically taken up to like hundreds and thousands of tunnelling times.
19:09
And we looked at like the First Order decay processes,
19:15
the leading order decay processes we see out of the statement understand that there are technical limitations.
19:17
So it's a very interesting thing where research is still going on, and I think it would take like.
19:22
Probably a decade or so more until we really can say that, yes, there was a very,
19:29
very hard proved that measles does really exist or that it does not exist at the moment, it looks like it probably does exist in one dimension.
19:33
And it's wide open in two dimensions for like arguments that go beyond what we can discuss here.
19:42
OK. This was like the last part of Feminisation, just to show that thermodynamics is extremely powerful,
19:47
but not all powerful, the estates that maybe do not families.
19:54
And now we can jump over to the or maybe ask us to ask questions on this part before I move over to the final part of the of the course.
19:57
Looks like no questions. OK, then let's move over and change gears completely for the last part of the course.
20:14
This is not about artificial food. And it's a very fancy term.
20:22
Let's break it down and get more pedestrian and say what we would like to do is we would like to simulate the effects of a magnetic field first.
20:27
You know that if you take your. Classical Hamiltonian and Hamiltonian for like a charged particle in the presence of an electromagnetic field,
20:36
the Hamiltonian is p minus Q times A will Q is the charge of the particles A to vector
20:45
potential of the electromagnetic field plus Q Times five or fi is to scale up potential.
20:49
So if you want to assimilate particles in the wild, you want to assimilate them interacting with electric and magnetic fields and.
20:55
I mean, it's like this magnetic field can be like an external magnetic field, like just given by an external magnet like style.
21:04
It can also be something internal to the material like this, and spin orbit coupling is also a consequence of a variety of this.
21:11
What a vector potential is and a billion. It depends on the spin of the particles that still spin orbit coupling effects,
21:19
which we also would like to simulate because they are relevant and kind of matter systems.
21:24
And ultimately, of course, you would like to also have a quantum theory for this field to vector potentially itself.
21:29
So you would like them to go to the economic theories which are like if you used that,
21:35
I used to this quite high energy physics and fundamental interactions and so on,
21:40
and doing quantum simulations of quantum dynamics would be something very, very great.
21:44
But we are still a little bit way, a little bit off of that.
21:49
So at the moment, we just say simply be certain we want to simulate the effect of a classical magnetic field that's just externally given by,
21:53
say, a coil or a magnet. So scale up potential.
21:59
We know how to simulate them, for instance, optical potential. That's how we do it.
22:03
But Steve, to potentially see you, this one is a challenge.
22:07
It's harder to simulate. So let's first look a little bit at what this does before and then we look at how we can simulate it.
22:11
So if you think about the charged particles in the magnetic fields, there's two main ways of thinking.
22:17
The first one is very classically mechanical is to say this to Lawrence us, right?
22:22
Q Times v Crosby. If I were charged particle magnetic field and I'm moving in this direction, I get a sideways force that deflects me.
22:26
And that's of course, the foundation of the cyclotron objects that have electrons in the magnetic field.
22:34
They will have cyclotron protections around this micro motions. And the second thing is,
22:40
it's also like the basis of the hall effect and kind of metaphysics where the
22:45
particles pile up on one side of a conductor and hence give rise to this hot effect.
22:49
So this is a mechanical effect where you really need the presence of the field if at the position of the particles, there is no magnetic field.
22:53
You don't have this Typekit effect. There is, however, also a second effect that you have seen in past two elected mix and optics.
22:59
That's the uniform effect.
23:06
That's the effect of saying there's a direct coupling as we see previously between the charge and the vector potential itself.
23:08
So the idea is that if I take a very long, thin solenoid which produces a magnetic field on the inside and of course,
23:15
the magnetic field lines are close to it, it will come back somehow the other way around.
23:22
But if I take the approximation of making the solenoid infinitely thin,
23:26
then the energy field of the outside goes to zero because the feed lines would simply spread over infinitely large areas.
23:30
And therefore, I have to say magnetic flux in all of the plane compared to like the little part in the inside
23:35
so it can neglect the outer Podsednik only have a magnetic flux in the inside of this.
23:41
Quite that's the approximation. And the idea is now that due to this term, queue times a Hamiltonian.
23:44
Even it takes a an election wave packet split into two parts sent, one left around and one right around this flux here,
23:51
I would pick up an additional face factor which is given directly hand of boom face, which is given by the magnetic flux Indian Coast area.
23:58
And people can make this experiment, you can take electrons have like an electron beam, which reflected two points,
24:08
and you measure the ready to face between the two electron parts here,
24:14
and you measure that as a function of the magnetic flux to your card in the middle. And you can see the face changing.
24:16
You can see it's the phase where you change a sinusoidal with the applied acrylic flux.
24:21
So it really. Follows this formula. The key thing about this formula is that it's proportional to the magnetic flux and through this enclosed area.
24:25
But it doesn't care about where the flux is.
24:35
So this is a non-local effect that really, even if the flux is only in the middle and the particles are well outside,
24:38
so they never encountered a flux directly, so they would never have a Lawrence force. Nonetheless, they see this description the vector potential.
24:43
And there's a whole bunch of literature in the foundations of quantum mechanics of saying,
24:51
is it really correct to discrepancies in non-local direction or should we like look at this in a different way?
24:56
And it turns out you can ask these questions in the local way, but it's much, much more complicated.
25:02
It's much, much easier to say there is this vector potential and it has this non-local effect.
25:06
It's an approximation in the sense, but it's standard in very, very good.
25:10
So this is what we can do here and now the idea is that this phase, as I said, can be done even if the fuse vanishes everywhere along the path.
25:14
And that's kind of like if you want one of the physical motivations of defining the spectre potentially in the first place,
25:24
because you can say that the Face ID I get is basically give them a ring and the quote when I integrate along this path,
25:29
the circle and integrates the vector potential along the circle.
25:35
So the vector potential is a part of physical reality, it has direct physical consequences.
25:40
Now you also know which we'll see on the next slide, I guess slide after next.
25:46
Is that the vector potential is depend. So we cannot say that this is the vector position,
25:50
you can measure it so you cannot match the vector potential at some point because it depends on the gauge.
25:56
But you can measure the closed loop of the vector potential, and that's how a form faced as close to pentacle is then a gauge independent quantity.
26:00
And there's a crucial distinction, which becomes clear in like 20 minutes or so. OK, so what is this mean that I just talked about?
26:10
Well, you know, that director potentially the magnetic field depends on the vector potential by just being by using the card of the call operator.
26:17
And you know, the electric field depends on the vector potentially using its tiny derivative.
26:25
And the freedom that you now have is if you say, well, E and B, I know they are committed and they are there now, what can I do to detect a potential?
26:30
Well, I can always take the vector potential a and it's to create a created future with so cases killer field.
26:38
And the question of that is something that it can act to the vector potential. And if I do this, B and E will be unchanged.
26:44
Q aesthetic, so it doesn't do anything to the tag derivative because this is a creative field gradient.
26:51
It means that the colour of a created to zero. So it does not change to be fit that I measure.
26:57
So this is the gauge freedom discus wise to this point of say, I used the London gauge or the cooling gauge or whatever is convenient.
27:01
It means that the vector value of the vector potential itself is not so important,
27:07
but the ring in the core of the vector potential is still important as a part of physical reality that's measurable observable.
27:11
So this is a static, we call it gauge for you because it has this great freedom.
27:18
That's where the term comes from.
27:23
Add more interesting and more complicated than chemical disputes, and there is no first proposal to how they can be simulated of cold atoms.
27:25
And people have kind of seen the microscopic fundamental little effect,
27:32
but we're still quite a bit away from doing a full fledged simulation of those things.
27:37
Maybe another five years, maybe another decade. OK.
27:41
So the challenge that we have, the problem that we have is that we have cold atoms, they carry no charge AQ or zero,
27:46
which means that all of these expressions, they're nice and funny, but they all zero because there's no charge.
27:53
So how can we simulate these effects? What can we do? And he had year in fancy language is to say, Well, you need to use synthetic fuels.
27:58
You need to do something synthetic, something artificial, that X acts like a gate, you put those particles synthetic foods, artificial gauge food.
28:06
That's the idea. In reality, what it means is to say, well, we know that if I have a field, my magnetic field somewhere,
28:13
I have to say how to form phase two, the quantum particle picks up when it goes around us.
28:21
So I can't have this directly, but I can have other phases, the berry phase of the payouts phase.
28:25
I explained what they on in the future and the next slide.
28:30
And we can use them to simulate the effect of this.
28:34
So if we can generate our interactions in such a way that they give rise to these kind of face factors,
28:37
then we simulate the effect of this magnetic field and the way we do it.
28:43
We called it a synthetic agent. So that's the idea.
28:47
So historically, the first idea of doing this was to start off with the mechanical thought was to say, Well, I have this Lawrence Falls,
28:51
which is proportional to queue times v Crosby and this v Crosby is kind of an interesting structure that we have to reproduce.
28:58
One way of reducing that is to say, well, we have to create your task force where we have and times v cross omega.
29:05
Omega is like the director of rotation. So maybe if we take our quantum guess, put it in the container and spin that container,
29:11
spin it up to certain angular velocity that would simulate the same quantum gas sitting statically somewhere in the presence of a magnetic field.
29:20
And it turns out, lo and behold, this was very successful.
29:28
And in 2004, two three four people showed us what, I suppose only confirm any quantum guesses.
29:32
Actually, I think for bosons, already ninety nine and the key hallmark feature they could observe was observing
29:38
vorticity that you could observe with the quantum gas when you expanded it.
29:44
In terms of light shows like many of those holds the regular hexagonal pattern of holds the vortices.
29:48
So it is what is still the same kind of vortices as you have them in type two superconductors for those that are aware of them.
29:56
If another way of them, it's due to the fact that the whole way function is a quantum mechanical wave function.
30:03
And if it's a quantum mechanical wave function, it must be well-defined at every point,
30:08
which means that if I have some kind of rotation, I would normally expect that because the particles are moving along this line,
30:12
I would expect to have a phase evolution here where the phase of the wave function is different here than here than here in here,
30:18
because the creating of the face gives me the velocity. So I would expect that if a face created here, but at the same time, a no go.
30:23
A closed loop. I must come back to the same face because of the way function must be single valued, which basically means that.
30:29
I have a quantisation in here to the face that I can pick up on a closed loop must be multiple of pipe.
30:37
And if I have that, that's fine. But I also have as if I have to snoop snooper, I pick up a face picture of two.
30:42
There must be some point you in the middle. What a face is not defined. And I can't have that.
30:48
So what what does Nature do? Well, they just says, what if I put the wave function to zero at that point, then naturally phases multiplied.
30:54
And that's what you get, which is what is this? What is this? You get a flux around each vortex, so the particles are kind of spinning.
31:02
Around each of these holes and in the holes, there's no particulates in the middle density zero to the way function vanishes,
31:09
so the face is not well-defined, but it's not a problem.
31:15
So we have set the quantum gas into rotation, which is exactly like the if you want the response you would expect in the cyclotron orbit.
31:18
And that would be a sign that you have not kind of if you want implemented this coyote is possible.
31:28
So you have similar to the magnetic field, so big success where people then it is to say, OK,
31:33
let's look at how many vortices do we get in the quantum system as a function of how fast we spin it?
31:38
And it turns out into something that one could calculate, but we don't do it here that for like Lomac feeds a low orbit,
31:43
low spinning rotations, you know what is he speaks to consider still sitting, still still the lowest energy state.
31:49
Then you get one vortex and you get more vortices and then you get like a turbulent pattern, something complicated and then you get no more atoms.
31:56
If you spin it too fast, it just doesn't work.
32:03
The particles basically spill out because you only have to Coriolis force yourself to centrifugal force.
32:05
And it turns out the point where you get many, many vortices is very close to the point where the centrifugal force is just overwhelming a trap.
32:10
So if you look at what is the magnetic flux that you can simulate, so how many mechanics flux quanta can you put in?
32:18
How many vortices can you put in per atom number?
32:25
This is a very, very small number, and it's far too small to enter the regime that people might be interested in,
32:27
namely the Quantum Hall, which we have two quantum hall effect where you need to have like one flux quantum per particle.
32:33
So it's a nice approach, but it doesn't really work for big systems.
32:39
Maybe if you go down to smaller systems that you put like three or four particles in a trap,
32:42
then you can maybe do a quantum simulation of the institute. What the what effect with this very, very, very small system?
32:46
And people are trying that because it's interesting in its own right, but it doesn't help you help us if you want to go on with the big ideas.
32:51
OK. So this is kind of like the introduction of artificial foods, what we want to do.
32:59
And I tell you in the next lecture quite a few ways how we actually do it.
33:04
Now I want to step. A little bit and talk a bit more mathematical about geometry and topology,
33:09
because these are concepts that we need to understand what's really going on.
33:14
So the first one that we should talk about is if we have a surface. Then we should talk we can talk about curvature.
33:19
What is the curvature of the surface? And the main unit for this one is got some curvature, which is the product of the two principle curvature.
33:26
So if you have, like a one dimensional line, it have kind of a curvature like this positive or negative.
33:34
And that's what we call the principal curvature of that line.
33:40
If you have a two dimensional surface, what you call the caution curve, which is the product of these two coverages.
33:43
So full coverage is infinity, the curvatures vanishes and you have you have a flat surface if what actually is this,
33:49
I think this principle, which is the inverse of what I just said. Sorry. So this is like zero curvature.
33:57
This is high curvature. Interesting. The important point by taking the product here is that you have the two sides of the two curvature of the two.
34:01
Principal coverage is coming in. So if you have something like.
34:09
A little Mountain Dew would have positive curvature if you have something like a little valley, you would have negative curvature.
34:13
But if you have something where you have like a where you have like a subtle point, then you can also get like an upper coverage.
34:19
The important point, actually, the important point for us, really is only that curvature or generally geometry,
34:26
this is the only thing we really need to like remember is a local property. It's defined at this point.
34:31
I ask, how is the surface curved at this point is covered this way or that way?
34:35
Or like a subtle point? Or is it flat? That's what I'm asking. It's a local property.
34:40
And the point is that I can now take this local property and continuously deform it.
34:44
If you like, take your orange and you squeeze it. Then the curvature changes at every point.
34:49
Do you expect it? No, this is just there.
34:55
Two contrasted with topology topology is the study of properties of space that are preserved under such deformations and the continuous deformations.
34:58
So cluing, bending and stretching a surface, but not tearing it apart, not cutting it.
35:08
Not gluing it together. And then you probably all have seen this cartoon many, many times where you can say that about logically speaking,
35:14
though not the lack of coffee is the same thing because you can continuously transform the one into the other.
35:21
You see that the key feature here is that both have one hole and to hold a number
35:26
of holes as to conserve quantity that does not change doing this dynamics.
35:30
And because I said no cheering, no clueing, you can't really change the number of votes,
35:35
so the number of votes here is a global property that you cannot change in that way.
35:40
It's a protected property. And that's what we call a topological property, a topology.
35:45
The other example of this one is the one I gave in the very beginning. It's the movie.
35:51
You take this one dimensional slip of paper and you clue it together.
35:55
You can a do it directly or can you first have, like, rotated it or rotated it twice included together?
35:59
And then once you have done this, you can take the fee, you can stretch it. You can do whatever you want to crumble it up this number.
36:05
In this case, a plus minus one rosette. How many holes do I have for how often have I turned the thing?
36:11
This number can never change afterwards again. And this number of symptomatically quantised it must be one or two four zero.
36:16
It cannot be 1.5. But if I think of gluing this together, I have turned it by turning it twice.
36:22
But I cannot have half turned it in. Just doesn't. It doesn't sense.
36:29
Doesn't make sense.
36:33
So examples of those things would be churn numbers, which will explain a lot of things like in the economy effect and topological insulators.
36:35
And we'll see that in the next slide. So these two things are connected.
36:41
They they're connected geometry and topology are connected in the colours of the surfaces.
36:48
But in the case of these classical surfaces by the gospel theorem, the mathematical theorem of the digital are so important.
36:51
The point is what they've shown is that if I take a two dimensional manifold,
36:58
so two dimensional surface think that's closed so it doesn't have any boundary.
37:02
So it's kind of closed onto itself like a doughnut or a sphere or anything like that.
37:06
And then I integrate the curvature over the whole manifold of the whole surface area with the greatest caution curvature.
37:10
It turns out that where we'll get is something of the form two times one minus new venue is a natural number two zero one two three four five.
37:17
No hope, no fracture, no nothing, it must be a whole natural no.
37:27
And it is called the genius of the surface.
37:31
So what this basically means now it isn't topological invariant, simply because this number must be an integer and natural number.
37:36
So what this means is that can take any kind of surface that I want. And sort that, according to Mr Prodigy.
37:43
There is the surface is like the sphere, like the Earth or something like the boy that we've seen before, very complicated but have no holds.
37:49
The other ones, like the donor that have one,
37:56
hold the other ones like this double donate that have to hold the other ones with three hoses, the creative and so on.
37:58
And this classification is robust. Which basically means that you cannot take any of those services.
38:04
The doughnut and here or whatnot, and I squeeze it away from it.
38:10
I do whatever I want to it as long as it continues and no cheering and accruing, and I cannot change this class.
38:13
If I'm in one class, I stay in one class. It's a topological protected property.
38:19
Any kind of local defamation that I do here cannot change the topological property because it's kind of a global property.
38:23
So that's how the protection comes about. And this is not OK, a funny piece of mathematics.
38:31
The question is, what does this mean in physics? And the first time it really shows up in physics is the integer quantum monolithic.
38:36
So I guess you are familiar with the setup. You have like a two dimensional conductor superconductor.
38:43
You have like a magnetic field pointing in that direction.
38:48
You send the current through here and you measure a voltage in the transverse direction to hold voltage.
38:51
And we kind of know from the what we discussed in the beginning that because of tolerance for all
38:57
of the particles are going this way to sort of currents flowing and have this magnetic fields,
39:02
they will be like drifting off to the side so they will pile up on this side.
39:05
I have more eloquence here than a few, so I got an electric field in this direction. That's the whole what they can measure.
39:09
And the question is not how is what is the relation between hall voltage and the current that through and the magnetic field?
39:15
And that is the day that the famous resigned from quitting.
39:21
So what you see here is this hard resistance.
39:25
So it's the alteration of the heart high voltage over the current resentful resistance as a function of the magnetic field in Tesla.
39:28
And this is the transverse one, the one that we should like first look at.
39:35
And the classical hall effect, if you just like, solve these kind of equations, you say, OK, well, this this term,
39:38
because B is bigger, I need to have a bigger e in order to compensate for that, that the current is flowing straight again.
39:43
So it expects that a good linear relationship between the voltage and the current and indeed for a very small magnetic fields,
39:49
you see this linear relationship, this classical relationship.
39:55
But then the very surprising thing that they found experimentally this is an experimental crawfish stress is they found this product, they different.
39:58
This is one pattern here where, like for a whole range of metallic fields, this hard resistance quantised to one very, very, very precise value.
40:04
And this. Conductance is high conduct.
40:15
So, yes, there's not the inverse of the hall, resistance to conductance is quantised to a very, very simple way.
40:18
It's quantised in units of squared over. So just the constants, times and C and in that no.
40:25
And that's exactly that, that will be quite a churn number.
40:33
And this is one of those topological invariant 6.1 mathematical reasons why this number can only be zero, one or two or three.
40:36
And that's not physically speaking, extremely surprising at first, and so that's where the main fascination of this whole topic comes from.
40:45
No, you would say, OK, I send particulates to it his way. Something happens to them.
40:52
Some of them end up on this side. So I got like a voltage here. That's fine.
40:56
But now normally you would save and or change my material a little bit.
41:01
Increase the magnetic field a little bit or whatever I do, I change parameters a little bit.
41:04
You would expect that the voltage would also change a little bit. It might be a very small change, but could be a change.
41:08
And this is kind of the first time that I see something where I can recall all of the parameters I can swap out,
41:14
the one gallium arsenide to another one reflects slightly different doping configurations with more disorder of less disorder with more temperature,
41:19
less temperature, and know this number was precisely put. No change that we can detect.
41:25
And people have measured this number of many, many digits of precision, and it's really, really, really pissed.
41:32
And that's extremely surprising, because all of the physics quantities that we normally have to like wheel numbers.
41:38
It could be 1.5 for to be 1.5 or one, and any small change to do here will have a change here, but you're not.
41:45
It's precisely hard quantised. And that's a big, dirty, heart hot many buddy system.
41:51
Well, if you could sort of room temperature, but it's not zero temperature.
41:57
And mathematically, we understand it by saying, well,
42:02
we know that these kind of numbers that are politically protected numbers, they can only have value zero, one, two or three.
42:04
It's inconceivable that a surface has 1.5 hold today.
42:11
It's inconceivable that this thing has like. They give one point five, it can be one or two.
42:14
And then because it's quantised, it has a certain resilience to it.
42:20
If I change parameters a little bit, there is nothing it can do. It stays exactly the same until I change it too much.
42:23
Then it jumps to the next discrete value. And that's the result of a logically protected quantities.
42:29
And just many of those. If I don't have an external magnetic field, but I just have like the spin orbit coupling in the material,
42:35
I end up with topological insulators, which have similar stories when I look at spin the charge.
42:40
If I take topological order like I have here and strong interactions, I can also get fractional quantum hall states.
42:46
So these photos don't have to be one two three four.
42:51
They can also be more exotic things like one third to fifth and so on when they have strong interactions in the game,
42:54
and that's still something that was observed. Maybe a few years after the integer got them, what effect?
42:59
But we don't have an analytical way functions and many of those cases, it's still a very complicated problem.
43:05
They have some so-called N.E.R.D. Excitations solicitations on top of this fractional quantum hall states.
43:10
They they're not bosons of fermions.
43:15
There's something else the anionic, which is pretty complicated but has very fascinating properties, for instance, quantum computing.
43:17
So there's also like a lot of interest with that perspective, understanding it's with you. It's better.
43:23
So in this direction, the holy grail is going to be to observe fractional quantum hall states.
43:28
And we're not there yet. We're like till the end of the course next week, we'll make it to the end of the integer quantum.
43:33
What effect? That's what has been achieved in the experiment. The fractional quantum dot effect.
43:39
Not yet. OK. So this is the interesting part about why what topology is interesting and what topological protection actually means in practise.
43:43
Now, let's go back a little bit and talk about ways how we can, like, create these kind of phases that we want to use instead of trying to form phase.
43:55
And this is not like a big introduction leading up to the concept of the very face. So the people that have seen it to be familiar to you.
44:03
First, let's talk about what is a geometric phase with a geometric phase, actually even what is determined.
44:10
And the simplest answer is if it takes something called power to transport, which we all have seen in your relativity class.
44:15
So you basically take like a vector two vector here they do transport it along a line and you transport it, touch it locally.
44:22
It always keeps the same. The same angle relative to the line that you transported long to you transport in
44:28
the parallel manner along the line that if you do this on a flat surface here,
44:34
you transport it this way, this way, this way and you end up of the same back that you had. So the dramatic phase in this case is zero.
44:38
But if you do this on a curved surface, say the surface of a sphere and you see here,
44:44
initially, my vector is pointing in the direction of the North Pole.
44:48
So I move it up along this line and you can see how it transforms into this vector.
44:51
And then I go sideways down here again. I keep this right angle here, constant all the time.
44:56
And then they go back along this line. You can see the director they end up with is not the initial vector.
45:01
It's a vector that's rotated by 90 degrees in this case.
45:06
And you can see that in this case, the angle of rotation is zero. In this case, it's 90 degrees.
45:11
And it turns out that the face that you get here, what it actually does is it measures the antiquated course and curvature to wonder,
45:17
defined earlier and closed by this chosen closed path.
45:24
And the face that you get here does only depend on the geometry of the path that you've taken.
45:30
It does not depend on how fast or slow you went along this path, as we knew the geometric phase just depends on the geometry.
45:36
It's independent of the speed with which you go to it. OK.
45:43
And now let's jump to the real Hamiltonian and see where such a dramatic face can show up in like the time of.
45:48
And that's going to be the very face that's going to be one of the main things that we use to stimulate magnetic fields.
45:58
So what we have is we have an Hamiltonian age that depends on a whole bunch of parameters are.
46:05
So it could be that can happen, Tony, that depends on the whatever you let us step to is trying to find directions.
46:11
If it's a magnetic field, be exposed by a couple of parameters, we just wait it very generally here.
46:17
And those parameters are on principle time dependent so we can change those parameters in time.
46:23
So we cannot, for instance, change strength and the direction of the magnetic field.
46:29
Or if we think about like having atoms in the laser field, we can change the tuning of the laser field and the Robbi frequency and time.
46:32
So I just like right on here, but I mean, after just to simplify rotation.
46:40
So I have the recruiting equation, which basically says that the time derivative,
46:45
part time derivative of my state society is just as time you get into melatonin time supply of standard.
46:50
And now I say that it's assumed that the Smithsonian has island states and it be just wide enough arm is the Earth,
46:56
I can see that Hamiltonian for the parameters are. If they were Tony, it depends on parameters to the island states,
47:03
but also depend on those parameters for change the opportunity to change the island states.
47:09
And NFR is an ideal set of temperature parameter,
47:15
so I can ride and between in time state equals just epsilon and the energy of the Untied States times that it's just I can.
47:19
I guess that equation.
47:27
So all of this is mathematically very, very trivial, but the step in the end is kind of surprising, hence we should like go through it carefully.
47:29
So let me start with an initial state saying I start of zero or my nation state is the end
47:37
state at the parameters to to have a time to do so initialise my system and I can state.
47:42
And now a two time evolution, I assume a few things I assume just to make life simple.
47:48
But the spectrum of Hamiltonian is discrete, so it has 10, 20, 30 states.
47:53
There is quite far away from each other and they're not degenerate. And let me also assume that the parameter of T is very adiabatic.
47:57
So I just changed the parameters for a change so very, very, very slowly.
48:06
Then you know that the adiabatic theorem tells you that the state society at the time
48:10
T would still be in the end state because it would just follow the EIGEN statement.
48:16
I would just theoretically follow the guidance. It could be the crown state could be one of the excited states.
48:22
It's an Oregon State and instantaneous. I think states would not change if I don't change R if I change asked low enough.
48:27
This carries over to the time of evolution and I we just follow this I can state adiabatic new.
48:33
OK. That's a. Does the typical the long time limit slow the limits limit that I have with quantum mechanics?
48:40
And for this, I need that the spectrum is discrete enough to degenerate because otherwise it wouldn't work.
48:48
OK, so I have this, so I stayed at the stated time. A time T will still be the end of the eigen state.
48:52
However, an alternate reality, it will have a phase of evolution. It will be easier to fight something times that state.
48:59
So I write down explicitly There's a face five t you.
49:06
And though I just plug all of that into the plug, all of that into the shooting equation, and then here's the equation I get.
49:11
Let me start here, just left inside of the shooting equation, I H-bomb time, time, evolution of society.
49:18
And this gives me two terms because now I have to the product of the Study III,
49:23
which depends on T and to have a state and which also implicitly depends on team.
49:28
So I have to take the time derivative on both. The first one gives me minus h bar fight that usually is five times D I can state,
49:32
and this is just the way I take the time the derivative of the i5 team.
49:41
And the second one was me, I brought you to the FBI duty of end, it's just the protocol of differentiation.
49:45
And this is the neutral. This is the term to be normally don't consider.
49:52
It says with the ideas that can change in time, I get this explicit term in the shooting equation.
49:55
Now I start on the right hand side. So to the Phi Phi Times, end is just the right hand side of the shooting equation here.
50:01
And then I know that this is just an island state of Victoria, so it is just in time, said.
50:09
OK, so now I just take out this part equals this part, and that's on the next slide.
50:15
And it basically gives me to this differential equation, you.
50:22
It just the recruiting equation in this for the entire state under its evolution, assuming 80 parties, would this basically it by now?
50:27
Multiply this with the state and E to the minus I-5 from left just gives me a differential equation for the phase five.
50:34
You can see here it's this funny structure appearing where I have a bar and DDT,
50:43
and that's basically this dead end with the end here and we at it from the left.
50:47
The face picked troubled. And this now basically gives me the differential equation for my face evolution.
50:52
And this is like the main goal of this,
50:59
but this is basically telling me is that the face evolution to the time derivative of the face of the wave function has two terms to it.
51:01
The first one is minus epsilon end of our H-bomb. And this is what we call the dynamical phase.
51:08
This is the face that you are familiar with. If I put the particle in, I can state has a phase evolution of the epsilon over 85 times to you.
51:13
And this is this phase of evolution. You did dynamic a phase. The bigger the energy, the faster my phase rotates.
51:20
But there's the second term, though here, which is basically the term that comes from this site here.
51:26
It's saying it's the time of time.
51:31
It's at the start of the state and take the time derivative of the state of the state, change in time I state and then projected back onto the state.
51:32
And this is a new term that you probably have not seen before.
51:41
And we just write it down here in a slightly different way because we are saying, well,
51:46
actually this time evolution is like a dramatic time evolution where we changed the parameters on time so we can write this as a gradient and ah,
51:49
and then, he added. And the good thing is that this one now creating an artist not depend on the path I particularly take.
51:57
It just depends on where I am at all. So it's like a property of the band structure in the end.
52:04
So the key thing here is that this is an extra term in a time evolution, and this is due to the time dependence of the Hamiltonian.
52:09
And when you think about it, you have a DADT here and a fight out here,
52:18
so you can integrate this up and you realise that the second part the phase
52:22
evolution indicates due to this part is independent of how fast or how slow you go.
52:26
It just depends. Steering integral over this guy here, which is just like the derivatives antiquated in parameter space.
52:31
And that's why this is a geometric phase depends upon the geometry, and the funny thing is that this is us in some sense,
52:39
a calculation that people could have written down in the 20s as soon as the shooting equation that you understand, I can see it.
52:46
You could have written the stone. You could have thought about this.
52:52
However, it was first written down in all generality by my sir Michael Barry in the 80s.
52:54
A a part of quantum mechanics that we just forgot about for 60 years.
53:00
And we had like an equivalent of this, an optics to punch a luncheon face, which was found like already 20 30 years earlier.
53:04
But the whole generality of this was only seen in the 80s. So what does this give us?
53:12
This gives us a geometric face, which is now called the berry phase, because Michael Berry is the one who found it.
53:18
So what we assume for this is we assume that we have a cyclic or cyclic adiabatic evolutionary parameter space.
53:23
So we assume that if this if you want to my parameter space abstract, I start at some point somewhere else and he goes back to the same point.
53:29
If I do this, I say I can say that after iftar time last year, the time that it takes for one loop,
53:38
the wave function at time T is the same way Fox has had in the beginning.
53:44
Plus a faith factor into the fight. The ideological evolution and the Setoodeh I five, I can write down astronomical face, plus the very face.
53:48
The chemical phase is just the integral of Epsilon T, so that's the one for the first part of phase evolution.
53:57
That's the one that you have to have seen before, and that's the one that, of course, depends on how fast or slow you go through it.
54:03
The second one, this contribution here is not a geometric phase, which is independent of the evolution speed.
54:09
And that's the story of the very face,
54:19
and we are going to use like this very faces next week to Thursday and the last lecture to understand how we can simulate magnetic fields.
54:21
And. Just to give you, like, could I come back to those lights next on Thursday?
54:29
But just to give you a quick view on how this looks, how it is going to look is we'll take this thing,
54:36
see gradient of see times, OK, and call this the very connexion.
54:40
And then we can take the call of this and call it the berry curvature.
54:46
That's why I was making so many points about curvature, because this is also a curvature.
54:49
And then our cheat sheet, oh, sorry, let me just come back to this light next week and very.
54:53
The cheat sheet is just to say that the structure of this one is the same as you have for the honeymoon phase you bury.
54:59
Connexion is going to play a role of like a magnetic vector potential in your.
55:04
Parameter space. And then the Berry curvature to cut off this will play the role of the magnetic field.
55:10
But the thing is that the magnetic field, of course, always lifts in real space,
55:17
and there's very faint, very connexion, they lift like an arbitrary parameter spaces.
55:20
So for instance, in the quartz movement, in space, in the free zone of letters.
55:26
And that's where we then going to see a topological structure popping up.
55:30
Because we're going to see the debate take this kind of berry curvature and integrated over the whole prison,
55:34
I get an integer like gospel theorem and that integer is going to be destroyed, a number which predicts the quantum what effect?
55:40
And don't very of the last two slides that were too fast. This is what I'm going to start with on Thursday.
55:48
But I wanted to get to that slide that you see where the road is ending. OK.
55:53
That's it for today. Thank you very much. Any questions?
55:59
Probably not, because there was a lot of fast stuff at the end.
56:06
They probably going to have a look at that and then you can ask questions about the slides if you've seen at the beginning of the last lecture.
56:10
So starting today, there will be the second round of the second round of the supervisions today, tomorrow, Thursday.
56:16
You should all have gotten an email from your supervisor when and where it's going to be.
56:23
If not, please tell me now, then I can like chase them up. And on Friday afternoon, we'll have to join the club again.
56:28
That's kind of like taking a step back because the journal club is going to look at the antiferromagnetic in the for.
56:35
How about model? And then next week there's going to be the last round of the supervisions and the.
56:43
Join the club and the Join the club is also a big opportunity for you to like,
56:50
have looked at the whole course and ask any questions that you might want to ask. Perfect.
56:55
Then I'll see you on a Thursday. Thanks a lot.
