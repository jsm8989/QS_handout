### Additional possible shortcuts (in the python script)
- way function into wavefunction
- And at the start of a sentence
- kind of (maybe replace it with "")
- right
- hall>Hall
- capitalise start of sentence (likely where "So" has been removed)
- other parameter > order parameter

### Thoughts
- wondering whether producing a coherent transcript is an efficient way to go? 
- Are there other tools that could pick up on a few more of the mistakes?
- Am I at the risk of spending too much time making the python script nice that it actually hinders progress?
