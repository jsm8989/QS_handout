So it's running. OK, that sound is going to spend a bit of a problem, but that is right.
0:04
Yes. So as I say, all you need to do is click, stop and follow the obvious promise to save your life.
0:12
But you give me a break right here. That's fantastic. Thank you so much. OK.
0:20
That's just one wonderful thing, he. Different veterans today.
0:23
Yes. Or extended well worth.
0:43
Robin? Sorry. Was that?
1:05
Oh yes. It feels a bit more like a meeting room, doesn't it, with the tables in the circle?
1:11
Hello. Give people a couple more minutes for life.
3:19
What like that? OK, then let's get started.
5:12
We'll see if anyone trickles in the list in the next few minutes. Hello, everyone.
5:32
My name is Stephanie Hart. I'm standing in for work today while he's off sick.
5:38
So, yeah, today we've got quite a fun set of things to go through.
5:42
So we'll be looking at some nice experiments that you can run using the post-COVID physics that you've been learning over the last
5:48
couple of weeks and then move on to some quantum thermodynamics and look at how we can define temperature in an optical lattice system.
5:55
So starting off with a nice experimental section first.
6:05
This picture you should recognise from last time or something, very much like it is the familiar superfluid to Mott insulator transition.
6:11
And you can see that here we have oops, the kind of sharp superfluid peaks that are characteristic of the superfluid in time of flight.
6:19
The interference peaks that arise from the coherence that the superfluid can have between lattice sites and hello.
6:34
In contrast with the most insulating phase that is much more blurry and smeared out and reflects the loss of that coherence between between sites.
6:41
And we probably haven't seen, is this picture arrayed in a right in a grid like this?
6:54
You've probably just seen one of these rows as a function of the lattice depth?
7:00
So the parameters that you've seen that you can tune in the Hamiltonian are the on site energy and the hopping terms.
7:06
And it's the kind of interplay between these that determines whether you're in the most insulating or the superfluid regime.
7:16
And that red line that indicates roughly that cut-off.
7:24
I'm. But experimentally, you can't directly tune on site interaction and hopping so directly.
7:29
So we rely on the experimental parameters that we can control the the power of our optical lattice beams.
7:37
So that determines the the lattice depth which is shown here in units of the recoil energy.
7:44
And we can also apply a magnetic field to tune the scattering lint that controls the strength of the interactions, so we have short scattering length,
7:51
meaning it is essentially a non interacting system versus very strong interactions with a much longer scattering length.
8:02
And. So these affect those you in terms, so for instance,
8:09
the latter steps will increasing that steps will increase the strength of the on site interactions slightly,
8:16
but it will also substantially reduce the tunnelling between the larger sites as the estimates become more localised to a single site.
8:23
And and so you can see that the combination of these parameters can affect.
8:34
The. And the point at which that transition between the Mott insulator and the superfluid occurs.
8:42
So those are the kinds of experimental parameters that we have access to.
8:51
In terms of actually creating a system, let's look now at some measurements that you can make.
8:56
So we've got here some in-situ images. I think most of the images you've probably seen so far have been time of flight images.
9:02
So here we've got a system that has been very,
9:10
very carefully loaded to the only loading one side of the optical one side, one layer of the optical lattice.
9:13
And you can then image that directly from above. And what we have here is moving from left to right with increasing increasing lettuce depth.
9:22
So left right the same as saying we're moving from the superfluid towards the insulating regime.
9:33
And what you can see very clearly here is that the actual density in the optical lattice starts to create quite a strong plateau.
9:40
Once you're in the insulating regime so that dense density is being, this is an N equals one insulator.
9:51
And so this is being pinned to a density of equals one in the centre.
9:59
Remember that you've got and the harmonic confinement underlying this,
10:05
so you're varying chemical potential, giving you the the superfluid outer shell.
10:09
And you can see this in these line plots, too, so this is extracted,
10:17
this and these plots are from the data extracted from these images, where you can see that the Mott insulator,
10:21
the red line up here is is pinned to that and equals one density, whereas the superfluid,
10:28
the compressible superfluid is able to get to a much higher density.
10:38
But then in that outer shell out towards the edges of the trap, those two lines start to overlap.
10:42
And from what we know.
10:49
Well, what we can measure about the density and what we know about the shape of the trough and therefore the chemical potential,
10:53
we can extract the compressed ability and that looks as we expect as well.
10:59
We see that the superfluid is compressible, somewhat insulating region right in the centre of that trap being breathability drops down to zero.
11:03
Where we fixed at, that equals one filling.
11:14
And the final thought is just that compressed ability data shown in a slightly different way.
11:18
So instead of being displayed as a function of the radius,
11:24
the distance from the centre of the trap that is now being plotted against the number of atoms per site and just
11:30
very clearly shows again this drop to zero compatibility as soon as we've entered the annexe one Mott insulator.
11:36
And. OK, so that's one type of in situ image that you can make where we just were able to see some some density of atoms,
11:48
but we can't, for instance, distinguish individual lattice sites.
11:59
If we did want to distinguish individual lattice sites, we could. We would just have to build an extremely high resolution imaging system.
12:04
And so you know that the lattice facing scales with the wavelength of the the light and that forms the the lattice.
12:12
So we're talking about getting a resolution here of three 400 nanometres, potentially.
12:23
Something else that you have to do if you want to make these single swipe
12:34
measurements and that the density is very low for the atoms on the on each side.
12:37
So you'll have to make you have to use fluorescence imaging in contrast with the absorption imaging techniques you've talked about previously.
12:41
And so this means that you will illuminate your atomic sample with light, allow those atoms to fluoresce.
12:50
As the first thing, they will start to heat up, so you need to simultaneously call them.
12:59
But one problem that you can't really get rid of is that while you're illuminating your sample to try to image them,
13:04
you can create an excited molecular state.
13:13
So two atoms can be exciting to a molecular state, lost from loss from the image completely.
13:17
And this has a fairly decent chance of happening,
13:27
so you can actually be pretty sure that if there's any pair of atoms on the latter site, they will be lost from your image.
13:30
So that's why we would.
13:39
So these are called little sister collisions, and this is why the quantum gas microscope this this single site resolution system.
13:41
Is more of a parity measurement of the occupation of the lot of sites than a direct representation of the number of atoms that you have on each site?
13:52
And you've got an automotive of atoms. One movie left in your final image, if you've got an even number.
14:02
You'll get these powers losses. I'm.
14:09
These are some very nice images from one of the first quantum gas microscopes, and so on the top row here you have just the raw data.
14:14
So these are individual atoms sitting on individual lattice sites, dressing and being imaged with extremely good resolution.
14:24
And from that measurement and from the knowledge of the underlying lattice structure,
14:33
this can be reconstructed and that is shown on the the lower panel.
14:39
Although such panels here and.
14:43
To try to identify where each where each outing is actually sitting and the middle row here is used to verify that process.
14:47
So that is the reconstructed image involved with the point spread function
14:58
of your imaging system so that then that can be compared with the raw image.
15:02
And you can see just by looking at it that it does show extremely.
15:07
Close agreement, not perfect, but that just shows us that this reconstruction is is fairly good.
15:13
So we see a couple of different regimes here.
15:21
Firstly, in this first column, and it's easy, so superfluid and you see that this looks quite noisy in the reconstruction.
15:25
There's yeah, there's just a lot of. Randomness or apparent randomness in that reconstructed image.
15:38
And this makes sense when you think about the person fluctuations that will exist on the
15:46
actual atomic density within that superfluid mapped down onto that parity measurement.
15:52
Things start to look a lot neater when we look at the Mott insulator, so on this.
16:00
Second column onwards, we have a much insulating state, so a very deep lattice and show show this much insulator with an increasing atom number.
16:06
So but with a low atom, no. What insulator looks very nice, you can see that you have almost complete filling of that central region of.
16:18
You optical lattice. A few small defects, and you can see that they map quite nicely between the reconstructed and the more data.
16:30
But as you increase.
16:40
The actual number, so this what insulating region gets bigger and bigger, which you'd expect you're adding more atoms to the system.
16:44
You get a few more defects appearing. And again, these are not very nicely between the real and the reconstructed images.
16:51
But then something quite interesting happens here. Where you start to get this.
17:00
Kind of doughnut type shape where you've got this inner ring that looks empty.
17:06
And this is where you have to remember that this is a parity measurement, that central region of the optical lattices is not empty.
17:12
That's the end equals to Mott insulator.
17:20
So if you remember that wedding cake structure that you're seen last time for the Mott insulator, you'll have the animals two in the centre.
17:22
So quickly draw this so you'll have the same size and equals two in the centre of a superfluid ring and then equals one.
17:35
For the outer outer layers, where this reflects the underlying harmonic.
17:56
Confinement of the optical lattice and. Increased, yes and no further.
18:03
And this continues until you start to see an end equals three not insulating core
18:09
surrounded by the apparently empty and equals two and then the animals one.
18:15
So this shows us that we can measure the insulating and superfluid states to really good accuracy,
18:22
but also that we can prepare an initial and what insulating state very, very well indeed.
18:30
Whether we want that to be an equal one and equal to we can control that.
18:36
And you can do some quite nice things with this and this example here shows an experiment
18:42
where the most insulating state is created and used to study quantum fluctuations.
18:49
So what we have here and this will be familiar from your treatment of the simulator, I think last time where you look at that,
18:59
when you look at the simulator using second order per second order perturbation theory, where if you've got these small fluctuations.
19:09
An atom might be able to hop to a neighbouring site,
19:23
and the picture that we actually have here is a little bit different to the ones
19:26
that you've seen before because we have tunnelling possible along the direction,
19:30
but no tunnelling possible along the way.
19:36
So instead of being a 2D array of lattice sites, it's more like one de chains that are all separated from each other.
19:39
So that whole thing process is only possible in the ex and not in the way directions.
19:48
So when this happens, you create neighbouring sites, one of which.
19:55
Is empty and the neighbour has a double occupancy, and this is called the double on hold on power.
20:02
And remember, the quantum gas microscope is a pretty image.
20:11
So this will show up as a pair of unoccupied sites.
20:17
And you can see this in the real data, too, so. Here we're going left to right from Mott insulator,
20:22
then reducing the lattice depth to go to a superfluid so the opposite way round from the way that it's normally shown.
20:30
And you can see here that in this reconstruction, you very clearly have these gaps appearing in pairs, which.
20:38
Is quite strong evidence of this quantum fluctuation process, whereas as you move towards superfluid.
20:48
You get more noise and more different kinds of fluctuations on top of that, so those fluctuations are a little bit harder to distinguish.
20:58
And if you want to look at this a little bit more quantitatively and you could
21:12
look at the the correlation function between them between pairs of lattice sites.
21:16
So here you're looking at the correlation of the parity operator at some lattice site K where you have.
21:22
You're looking at this delta and which is the deviation from the mean density.
21:33
So if you're on a given site, if you have an empty site or a.
21:41
An empty site or W occupied site that deviation B plus minus one.
21:50
If you've got a single occupied site, that deviation zero,
21:54
which means that that power temperature becomes minus one or plus one, depending on whether you have single or.
21:58
I'm. Either occupied or zero occupied sites.
22:07
You can look at the correlations between those. And you can plot that data, so in red is the um, the correlations in.
22:13
In the X direction in blue, you see the correlations in the Y direction.
22:26
We would expect the blue data to be completely uncorrelated because you shouldn't be able to have hockey in the white.
22:31
But for the blue, do you see that you have quite good agreement at loJ of you in this region to this dash dotted line, which?
22:38
Is the result from second order perturbation theory, actually?
22:51
I'm sorry. First order perturbation theory, it says in the caption and.
22:56
Then you can create an increasingly sophisticated models that will capture the full physics of this, so the second curve there is.
23:02
It's a more sophisticated and. Simulation that.
23:15
And then the solid line again, you just adding more facts,
23:22
so you're incorporating the effects of the underlying harmonic confinement and also the finite temperature,
23:25
which then starts to give you a much closer agreement to your data.
23:32
So you can see that it's only in the. In the small share of a regime that that particular approach really captures what the experiments are doing.
23:38
Which is, as you'd expect, for instance, if you have a finite temperature,
23:52
you're going to start to see other effects that start to overshadow those quantum fluctuations.
23:57
But one final example to show before we pause for a moment, this is not examine the bill, it's very different to the examples we've seen before.
24:05
So I think most of the examples that seen before have been using optical lattices to study systems that look somewhat like lattices.
24:15
But this is an example of using an optical lattice to reproduce some of the physics of the Higgs mode,
24:24
which would only be associated with this kind of potential where you've got a ring shaped potential like a flat ring.
24:31
But and this has to excitations associated with it, so got one mode that will.
24:42
Well, one expectation that will be along the flat ring, so that should be a gap plus expectation.
24:50
But then you've got this Higgs mode, the. The gap excitations will oscillate in that kind of radial direction.
24:57
And as you change the potential, those modes get kind of softened out and.
25:04
So this doesn't look anything like an optical lattice. But optical lattices can have excitations, too.
25:11
So what we have here is an experimental sequence in an optical lattice system where a lattice is loaded and
25:18
the intensity of that lattice the the last step is modulated at some fixed frequency for a short duration.
25:27
And. Then. So to it's just held a lot of families,
25:34
and then the temperature is measured and and expectations will cause heating so that temperature measurement allows.
25:40
Allows you to measure where the excitations occur.
25:51
And what you see experimentally is that those exhortations have some.
25:57
Um, finite offset in frequency, so the data is run lots of times with lots of different modulation frequencies in the lattice.
26:05
And so you get this quite interesting when she thought that the key feature there
26:16
is this is this offset in the frequency and this can be plotted and as you move.
26:20
Between sip fluids or from sip fluid towards the Mott insulator.
26:29
That frequency of searches offset decreases, and this corresponds to the softening of those modes that we saw in the previous sketch.
26:36
The other side is just the regular Mott insulator. We would expect the potential to be capped anyway, but we wouldn't necessarily expect.
26:47
Expect that in the superfluid. So this is just an indication of an optical at a system that is being used to recreate the physics of these gaps,
26:55
excitations in the superfluid that recreates.
27:09
Physics that is more traditionally associated with high energy physics, and so, yeah,
27:14
that's just one quite neat example of a different sort of application of optical lattice simulation.
27:20
So before we move on to much to the thermodynamics, do you have any questions on?
27:26
Any of the previous experimental ones? It's kind of curious.
27:35
He said, in the way that their ideology is worth much into how much.
27:44
Kind of extraordinary, do they need to go forward? I think we know about fixing citations and particle physics to.
27:51
We want to see. So.
27:59
Yeah, and that's that's a good question. And so. I guess it's experimentally this has been has been demonstrated, and I think there are a lot of.
28:06
There is a lot of discussion. So if I'm kind of interpreting your question correctly,
28:20
there's a lot of discussion about the extent to which quantum simulation in optical lattice really represents.
28:24
The other kind of physics and whatever it is that you're trying to simulate. So there are.
28:33
I think there's still quite a lot of theory work that needs to be done on some of
28:41
these systems to either properly quantify the limits of the quantum simulation.
28:45
So. So is it enough to just reproduce a similar effect?
28:51
Does that tell us enough about? The system that we're trying to study, even if it's not a perfect.
28:57
Replica of that. Or is it more useful to try to incorporate more three effects that would otherwise occur?
29:04
So. I think that question will probably have a very different answer, depending on who you asked.
29:13
It's a very interesting question, definitely. OK.
29:21
Let's spend the next half hour or so talking about the thermodynamics of a cold atom system, more specifically an optical lattice system.
29:29
And here we'll be trying to address the main question of how you actually define the temperature of.
29:40
A system of cold atoms in an optical lattice. So.
29:48
Let's jump back to a comparison with solid state physics, the kind of.
29:53
First or most obvious linked system that we often try to simulate.
29:58
So in solid state, you will have a system that is in contact with some experimental apparatus.
30:05
You can have heat exchange particle exchange with some external reservoir.
30:12
And so it makes sense to describe this in terms of the grand canonical ensemble where
30:16
you have your chemical potential and your temperature defined by your environment.
30:21
This is very different and called out some systems, so.
30:29
We know that we have our cold atoms in in a vacuum chamber trapped in a lattice of in a laser lattice.
30:32
And we can't have experiments assemble contact with the experimental apparatus.
30:41
We actively avoid that. When you take the sequence step by step, there are different a few different stages.
30:46
So let's take the cooling process of actively cooling.
30:55
I'm sorry about cooling that. And this can be described as semi-open.
30:59
So you in evaporating away your high energy atoms, you are decreasing the atom number and you're decreasing the entropy of your system.
31:05
So that's kind of open stage of your cold atom experiment.
31:15
And once you've loaded into a lattice, your system is closed and you have that.
31:21
Well, assuming that you've done everything right and you don't have terrible losses and you're asking, no, your entry should should stay constant.
31:29
So at first glance, it's very difficult to see how we would define the temperature because we don't have an environment,
31:40
we don't have an external temperature to relate this team. So let's look at that latest loading stage and a little bit more detail.
31:45
So the various parameters that we might be able to define and let's take them one by
31:56
one and think about whether they are conserved or not during that legislating process.
32:02
So energy is not conserved.
32:09
You can do work on your system.
32:13
The optical lattice system is a little bit more complicated, but if we just take the simple example of a harmonic oscillator,
32:15
we know that if we make that harmonic oscillator tighter or or weaker, we're going to change the separation between the energy levels.
32:21
We're changing the energy scales of our system. Likewise.
32:32
Temperature will also be affected. By the form of the trapping potential.
32:40
And. The are number assuming that you're doing things well and you're not you don't have losses and the outcome number should be conserved.
32:48
But once again, because the energy is changing, the chemical potential is not conserved.
32:58
That leaves us one quantity that we're pinning all of our hopes on to. And that is the entropy.
33:05
And the entropy can be conserved. It's not necessarily in order to conserve entropy.
33:11
You need your transformation to be a diabetic, so you need it to be very, very slow.
33:19
And we should remember. That let's let's assume that we've made a nice adiabatic transformation into our optical lattice once with a.
33:27
From the second verse from the second law thermodynamics, we can't decrease that entropy further.
33:42
So whatever entropy we go into our optical lattice with, we can make it worse.
33:48
We can we can increase the entropy, but we won't be able to decrease that entropy.
33:54
So we have to do as much work as possible to decrease the entropy before loading.
33:59
And also to make sure that we're not adding more entropy in during that loading process.
34:05
And this is always a conflict. In just experimentally, because.
34:10
You want to if you want to be adiabatic, you want to load as slowly as possible,
34:18
but then that's going to to run this conflict with the finite lifetime of the atoms in the trap and any heating or noise effects that you might have,
34:22
which will heat the atoms up. So that's always going to be a bit of a compromise.
34:32
But if you design your your sequence as carefully as possible,
34:38
you can assume that the entropy is going to be roughly the same in the optical lattice
34:43
as it was in the harmonic trap before lattice loading or at least very similar.
34:48
And so it's this knowledge of the entropy that we will use to define the temperature of the lattice.
34:56
So let's think about how to do that, because there's a bit of a conceptual trick to this.
35:06
So if we just take a whole system,
35:12
a whole closed system that would be described by the microeconomic ensemble where you're conserving the atom, no entropy and the energy.
35:14
But. If we take out some small part of the system and just say this is some small sub system that is equilibrated with.
35:28
The rest of your system, so the the majority of the system acts like a reservoir, and we just have this small subsystem,
35:38
and then we can start to describe this in the grand canonical ensemble and define the chemical potential and the temperature.
35:47
The only problem is we have no idea what the temperature is of the the main system that we're using as a reservoir.
35:55
So let's split this up further into lots of smaller subsystems.
36:04
And for each of these, we can measure locally the awesome Oops, we the atom density as a function of new A.
36:09
And also the local entropy.
36:21
And by integrating these over the entire system, we can then extract the actual number and entropy and for just experimentally for that system,
36:24
and then we can work out what combination of chemical potential and temperature
36:39
are needed to obtain those measured values so we can use that measurement then to.
36:44
To get a temperature for our system. And this can be applied to in homogeneous systems as well as homogeneous systems.
36:51
And you might already spotted this trick of splitting everything into subsystems looks
37:01
a little bit like the local density approximation that you learnt about previously,
37:06
where you've defined your chemical potential locally as your kind of central chemical potential.
37:11
With an offset determined by the potential that the underlying potential of the system.
37:19
So while your chemical potential will depend on the position in the trap, the the temperature doesn't.
37:28
So. That is how we go about finding the temperature.
37:38
But let's talk a little bit more like take a little digression into talking about entropy and how entropy is defined in a cold atom system.
37:45
So. It's very convenient to, or some would argue, more correct to work in terms of the von Neumann entropy,
37:53
which allows you to express the entropy in terms of your many body.
38:06
Um, you have anybody descriptions of any body density matrix.
38:11
And that's really handy because you can diagnose your identity matrix and your entropy takes this very nice form,
38:16
which allows you to get any kind of intuitive picture of what's going on.
38:26
So to see that will take a couple of examples. The first is a pure state at zero temperature, not pure state.
38:32
Rogue One one. First element of our identity matrix will be one.
38:42
And so the ground state T equals zero, every other diagonal element will be zero.
38:48
And so HP will be zero, and this kind of makes sense when you think about the state as well, you would expect that entropy to be zero.
38:58
We take the opposite limit. We want to maximise our entropy now, and we do that by making our state as mixed as possible,
39:06
so assigning an equal probability to any of the different possible.
39:15
And he's a different possible states in our system, which then gives us a diagonal density matrix elements will all be the same and
39:23
they will all be won over and when is the dimensionality of our Hilbert space?
39:34
So this will maximise our entropy and this.
39:39
As as his look and is known as the entropy capacity, the the greatest entropy that can be associated with that system.
39:43
Just to put some typical experimental numbers to that.
39:53
If we've got 10 to five atoms in our system, our entropy roughly scale as Boltzmann constant times the number of of atoms,
39:58
which gives us a very, very large and associated Hilbert space, so often quite simple examples.
40:09
This isn't a calculation that you would run by hand, but it does give a quite nice.
40:16
Picture of what's going on. It's important to remember that this entropy isn't a direct observable of our system.
40:23
And so we have to make some of the experimental measurements that we discussed before.
40:32
OK, so that was our entropy, and let's quickly take a look at what the density matrix will look like for a thermal state.
40:40
So. This is purely thermal. Don't need to worry about those of Fermi statistics.
40:48
We just need to worry about and statistics, and so density matrix elements will be scaled as each of the minus.
40:54
Um. And it's important to remember that most density matrices that you could write down will
41:05
not just describe a small state like this because you require that Boltzmann type scaling.
41:16
And an interesting question is raised here.
41:23
Which is that we know that time evolution. In quantum mechanics, this unitary.
41:29
Which implies if you start off with that perfect ship of state that we saw in the last slide, that state should stay pure.
41:35
Always. And something interesting to think about that you'll cover later on is how can we think of a poor state?
41:42
Oh yeah, a few states are realising and say something to think about for future lectures.
41:52
So let's look back. At some measurements that can be made here,
42:02
so we've already said that if we want to measure the temperature or define the temperature of an optical lattice, we need to.
42:06
Make some measurements of the. If the number,
42:17
density and the entropy of of the system and trace that back to find the temperature that you would expect would give those measured values.
42:22
And we've got an example here. And as with all of these, it's been cut off from the slides, but you have it in the lecture notes,
42:34
and it's a good idea to look through some of these papers as well and repercussions and really digest what they're trying to show.
42:43
What we have here is a comparison of the temperatures that are being extracted
42:51
from an experiment with the temperatures that are the best fit from simulations.
42:57
So the top pro here is.
43:03
The time of flight back to time flight images from as you increase the temperature of a cloud that's being lowered into the trap.
43:09
This looks a lot like the superfluid too insulated pictures that you've been looking at before.
43:18
It's not. This is just superfluid turning into thermal state,
43:23
and the temperatures that are written in the top panels are the temperatures that are that are associated with.
43:28
That person we mentioned before, so measuring the temperature and the entropy before loading.
43:39
And. Thinking about how that entropy will change during loading and mapping that back to find the temperature of the optical system.
43:48
The next row down is a quantum Monte Carlo simulation of of that system.
44:00
And. Many, many of these simulations will have been run and the one that provides the best fit to the experimental data selected and said,
44:08
OK, this is the one that describes our system. The best bit is the temperature that we have simulated based on this data.
44:20
And you can see that on this lower clock here.
44:31
This is just cut through the data and you can see that you have very good agreement even on some of these quite small scale features here,
44:33
some small deviations. It's not completely perfect, but it's a fairly good description.
44:45
And if you look at the temperature that's extracted from those simulations.
44:52
It's again, it's it's a fairly close agreement with the temperature that was extracted experimentally.
44:58
And. That. Not only does it nicely illustrate extracting a temperature from.
45:06
From from your measurements, it also gives some confidence in the assertions that the entropy.
45:17
Is preserved fairly well, not perfectly, but fairly well during that loading process.
45:26
So say to some quite nice reassurance.
45:32
Of. Everything that I've claimed without evidence so far.
45:37
OK. And. This can all be studied,
45:45
remember that a lot of the simplifications that will make for these systems is to consider a zero temperature system that we can look
45:51
now at the finite temperature now that we've known now that we know how to define the temperature and look at the finite temperature.
46:00
Both have a face diagram and you can see that we have some critical temperature associated
46:06
with this kind of boundary between the superfluid and a normal and normal fluid,
46:14
and that will vary with this ratio.
46:22
But we always care about this ratio. You have a J and this will this critical temperature will keep decreasing.
46:27
Until we reach our quantum critical point, which marks the face and just transition between superfluid and Mott insulator.
46:36
Which then will look like and look very much like the pictures that you've seen before of that superfluid insulator transition.
46:48
So yes, it is worth highlighting that that critical temperature will vanish at the quantum critical point.
46:56
I'm. And you can. Also,
47:05
compare this with the well you can you can plot this critical temperature directly
47:12
as well and compare that with once again comparing it with the simulations,
47:19
and you see that there's. A fairly good agreement. Between the experimental data and the simulations for this process.
47:24
OK, I'm. So. One final part of the kind of main discussion here is once again looking at that quantum gas microscope,
47:38
so back to single site resolved imaging and in our optical lattice.
47:49
And. You can actually get a fairly good idea of the entropy of the system.
47:56
So this is and as in the average of the atom density in.
48:03
In a scintillating system so plotted as a function of the radio distance from the centre
48:12
and the yellow line here is an end equals one Mott insulator so you can see the density.
48:18
It's fairly stable at the density of one, you go into this superfluid shell and then have zero density.
48:26
So exactly as you'd expect, the Red Line is an equal to Mott insulator exactly as before parity measurements.
48:35
So you have apparently zero density in centre is actually an equals to superfluid region.
48:44
And equals one, I'm back down to zero.
48:52
And you can also look at the fluctuations in, um, in that density, which gives a fairly good idea of the entropy of the system.
48:56
And you can see that where the density is very low, you have very low fluctuations, as you would expect, but these fluctuations from a peak.
49:07
Wherever the density goes to how filling, and that makes sense as well, because.
49:16
When you have this halfling region is kind of an equal probability of having either occupied or not occupied.
49:26
So the fluctuations there, we would expect will be very strong.
49:35
And this is consistent between the end equals one on the inequality whenever we get this whole feeling and the fluctuations will peak.
49:40
And. This can be this radio distance can be mapped onto a chemical potential and exactly the same data plotted, so it's just taking this.
49:49
Slice that you've seen before. Down the down the chemical potential.
50:06
And you can see that there's this very nice overlap, then between the data for the end equals two in and equals one mott insulators.
50:12
And what's again, this peak in fluctuations at this halfling region?
50:20
And. We know that we're in the deep, flattest limit,
50:29
so we don't have correlations between a lot of sites and so that we know that the entropy that we're measuring is just a local entropy.
50:35
And it is governed by this the statistics of the occupation of each site.
50:45
But. This data also shows something quite interesting,
50:52
which is that the entropy she something I forgot to highlight here was that while the entropy peaks at this half filling.
50:58
The entropy is lowest or very low during inside those insulating regions.
51:07
So. And we can argue that the entropy is actively pushed away from the insulating regions into the superfluid regions,
51:16
and this kind of makes sense as well because we know that.
51:26
A system will want to minimise the energy cost associated with with the entropy and in the Mott insulator.
51:32
There's a high energy cost associated with with putting entropy into that backup system,
51:45
but in superfluid that energy cost is much lower, so all of the entropy will be pushed into the superfluid and.
51:52
It's that final point there that actually this can cause heating of the superfluid shell.
52:01
So it's actually a little bit debateable whether we should really be saying that these regions here are actually a superfluid.
52:06
Or are they normal fluid because they've been heated by this entropy redistribution?
52:13
OK. But. One last quite cute.
52:22
Examples show right to the end, but do you have any questions? On the summer genomics part.
52:31
OK. Excellent. So again, not examiner.
52:41
This is just a curiosity, and it's quite exciting,
52:46
this is work that is actually going on in some of the labs downstairs as we
52:50
speak and trying to create negative absolute temperatures in an optical lattice.
52:55
So I'm. We've seen that the optical lattice system.
53:02
But can we were in the optical system, we can use the speech to find the temperature?
53:10
Now let's look at what happens. When?
53:15
When we play around a bit with the energy and the entropy in the system, so we know that we have the relation.
53:21
When I was a teen year by the E! So.
53:34
If you are increasing the energy of your system, you would expect to increase the entropy, increase the temperature.
53:43
So let's look at this example here where we've got a very low energy system, very low temperature, all of the atoms occupying.
53:54
That the lowest energy levels in the system. And so the entropy is going to be very low indeed.
54:04
This is all governed by Boltzmann statistics in a site.
54:11
So I'm. Let's add some more energy to our system, and higher and higher energy levels will start to be occupied.
54:16
This will increase the entropy of our system. And.
54:25
Again, all make sense here you are occupying those states, according to polls and statistics.
54:32
You just increasing the disorder in the system as you increase the temperature and increase the energy of the system.
54:37
Now, this could go on forever. So let's put a lid on our system.
54:44
And we say that we maximise the temperature when.
54:50
All of our states are. Equally occupied.
54:56
Let's do that. Think about that exponential that requires a temperature of infinity.
55:01
And. We don't need to stop that.
55:07
So we carry on adding energy to our system, and we start to see that we start to decrease our entropy once again, so exact mirror of what we had here.
55:12
We're increasing our energy, preferentially occupying the states at to the higher energy levels of the system, decreasing our entropy again.
55:25
Now, if we are decreasing our entropy by increasing our energy, that implies that our temperature is negative.
55:35
And we can get two negative zero temperature again, and by increasing our energy so further until just the highest energy levels are occupied.
55:46
And. So this leads to some quite interesting consequences, so we kind of say that.
55:58
Negative temperatures are actually hotter than positive temperatures,
56:08
if we put them in thermal context and heat is going to flow from the picture on the right to the picture to the left of it.
56:11
So our negative temperatures are hotter than positive temperatures and.
56:19
Because we're going to see. Yes, that was it.
56:30
And we've got this strange discontinuity at the centre at this plus minus infinite temperature, and that one at least could be resolved when.
56:33
And remember that typically, instead of working with temperature, you're actually working with beta, which is the inverse of temperature.
56:43
So that results at least that strange discontinuity there.
56:50
Um. But. This isn't something that we see in everyday life.
56:57
And that is because in everyday life, our energy scales are bounded from below.
57:03
To achieve this, we need a Hamiltonian that is bounded from above.
57:08
And this is what we get from band structure and knots, colitis or at least on the kinetic energy, so band structure provides,
57:13
if we've got large enough band gap, our kinetic energy will be bounded from both above and below.
57:22
But we have three times and I both have a Hamiltonian.
57:29
So let's think about each of those because our interaction and potential energies are currently bounded from below.
57:32
So what we can do is increase our of strength so that we're ramping into a really deep Mott insulator.
57:39
Atoms of pins to individual lattice sites, kinetic energy already has bound from above and below.
57:45
We don't have to worry about that, our interaction and our potential energies we can reverse.
57:50
So again, using a magnetic field to sweep the interaction energy, reversing the sign of the confinement to put enough about on the potential energy.
57:57
Lower the latter steps again. And our atoms are in a negative temperature state.
58:07
This has been demonstrated experimentally in.
58:14
Some lattices already in 2013, and this is experimental data that shows can in time of flight that a different region
58:19
of the band structure is being occupied consistent with the stable occupation of.
58:28
All the negative temperatures state, and we're trying to do that.
58:35
Right now in some more interesting places, downsize as we speak, so stay tuned to hear more about that.
58:40
Yeah, that's everything for today. Anyone has any last questions.
58:51
Speak now. When you reverse the confinement, right, you can really quickly.
58:57
OK. So just give us a really good question.
59:05
So we do still have the underlying letters. So we were reversing the sign of the underlying.
59:09
Harmonic confinement, so turning that from kind of this picture.
59:14
To this one that the atoms themselves are at least still confined in the optical lattice wells, so it's.
59:20
Fairly stable, so we there are limits to how long we could hold them for.
59:30
And there's a lot of. Discussion amongst people who are very passionate about family dynamics as well, about kind of the limitations on.
59:38
And if this couldn't exist, if it was in equilibrium with the outside world, if it was in contact with the outside world and.
59:51
But as as a closed system, that negative temperature state is stable.
1:00:00
And if. I say this, if you're here for one B physics, you actually showed the negative temperature states should exist.
1:00:14
By thinking about. Yeah, I feel like this is just a very quick exercise for you to go through if you're interested.
1:00:27
So we know that we've got the probability of state on station just from counting.
1:00:39
If you take some small energy away from this, you get this form.
1:00:51
And from there, you can show that the temperature of your systems.
1:01:06
It looks like this. And if you plot this, you see that you can get a negative temperature.
1:01:21
So if you haven't been through that calculation or you haven't seen it recently, it's just a nice, simple two level system picture of.
1:01:26
Everything we've said here. OK.
1:01:36
Which case, and that's one of the questions we should probably clear the room.
1:01:42
But thank you so much.
1:01:46
