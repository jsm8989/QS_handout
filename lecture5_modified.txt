Hello and welcome to lecture five of the quantum simulation course. Today's topic is both on lattices, and then we would talk about how we can introduce the interactions between both zones, which would then be the full Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. And then we will look at the ground state phase diagram of this Hamiltonian. And we see the first transition from a superfluid into a Mott insulator.

OK, let's get started. We start with a quick reminder of Bloch waves from last weak, basically because our lattice potentials are periodic. The Bloch theorem applies and all of the states will be Bloch waves. We'll have energy gaps in the same way as solid-state physics. And the easiest way to think about these Bloch waves and to think about how we can represent them is to start by looking at the photons again, and to say that the new thing in the lattice is that an atom with momentum $p$ can absorb a photon from the left beam, changing momentum by $\hbar k$ basically. Then the overall state is given as a superposition of plane waves, and the only task that remains, which you are doing in the problem set, is the calculation of these coefficients in front of this.
[eqn]
And this has very important consequences and the very intuitive way of thinking about the system, because when we do time of flight, when we say, okay, how do we take a measured momentum of a particle. We basically do this by this time of flight imaging where we switch off suddenly the lattice, which basically means we project our Bloch wave, we've acquired momentum $q$ onto the constituent plane waves. And that means we would see for each Bloch wave a set of peaks at discrete points after time of flight. And then we said, okay, we'll also want to move over to a bunch of functions because we said very often it's inconvenient to have momentum space representation, because the interactions are local, because the real space potentials, traps and other things that we might want to add, are local. We will want to have a real-space representation. And all of you have seen these Wannier functions before. I should maybe say a few more words about them. The first thing is, again, the reminder that the Wannier functions are defined as a discrete sum of the waves and we're basically doing this just in a given event. Do we get the Wannier function in this band? We don't take all of them, just the ones in one Bloch wave. And these Wannier functions are localised around two sites. In the permanent atomic limit to some here turns into an inegral, which is not clear to everyone. The reason for this simply is that very often if you do a numerical calculation, you will only say, I don't want to calculate an infinitely large lattice, I want to calculate the lattice with say a hundred lattice sites, which is down in the big box potential. This means it makes sense to only have one hundred Wannier functions.

You can think of a particle in a box. The ground state will have one momentum $k$ and another at $-k$, you can't fit all others in there because you have this box. And the same thing, of course remains true if you have a lattice. If the lattice lives in a finite box, you only have discrete momentum states that are possible. These $q$ here are discrete and then you have a sum over discrete momenta. And in the thermodynamic limit, if your box becomes infinitely big, you go from the box into freespace. Just keep lattice potential there. Then this turns into a continuous distribution. And you go from the sum to an integral. And the last thing that I was making a point about, which I think is very important, is to say that the Wannier functions form an orthonormal basis of the full single-particle Hilbert space. That basically means that whatever physical situation you have, you can describe this all in plain waves. It's a valid basis, but it's a very inconvenient basis because momentum is not conserved. You can describe it in Bloch waves, which is maybe for many things a better basis because the quasimomentum is conserved. And the band index very often is conserved because very often you don't have situations with interband scattering. You can also very often do everything in this basis of Wannier functions. It's also a complete basis because you have these nice properties that these are the most local functions.

If we go away from all of the maybe more abstract definitions you can really think of, a Wannier function as having half an atom in the lowest band, and that atom is localised on one lattice site $i$ that this is in, this one you from the atom is this Wannier function centre. And this lattice said if the atom was to be formed on that lattice site, then it would be the Wannier function centred around this lattice site.
[pic]
And if we wouldn't if it would be in a different band, then it would be the Wannier function of two different bands, which would have a different look. If you think of relatively deep lattice, where each lattice site is a harmonic trap, then the lowest Wannier function becomes a Gaussian and the first excited Wannier functions become the excited states of the harmonic oscillator. And for those that are maybe a bit more mathematical minded, here's another way how you can think about this. If you say I want to have a localised particle with space now outsite of the lattice in freespace, you would say the most localised to I can write down is the Delta function, $\delta(x-x'). And you know that you can express this as an even superposition of all of the plane waves each of the $x$. Now, the same thing is true, you should look to the basis transformation from the plane waves into the Bloch waves, because we said that the Bloch waves are often the basis of the full Hilbert space, the same way as the plane waves. I can expect the same thing. The delta function I can express as a sum of all of the Bloch waves. And now if you now say that this has restricted us now to a single band, there's no sum over all of the bands in here anymore. And just looking at one single and then you can think of this as, say, I have less momenta at my disposal because many of the plane waves are known what they are, many of the Bloch waves are not there because they live in different bands, which means that I have less momentum states so they can play with less basis states of which I can make a localised function. The function would be less localised. It would still be localised around a single lattice site, but it would not be as localised as a delta function. And the function I get is then the Wannier function.

And the last step that we did in the last lecture was to say no, that we have to as basis of maximally localised orbital so of the wavefunction that describe a particle sitting on one lattice site in the lowest band, and we can then write down the Hamiltonian for such a particle.
[a dagger]
creates the particle Wannier state onsite. And then the Hamiltonian fundamentally describes the two terms. We have the kinetic energy, which is basically saying the particles moving around. And we say particles move from site $j$ to site $i$. The summation is just over pairs of nearest neighbours, because we are in a so-called tight-binding regime where particles can only hop from one site to its neighbouring site. We also said that in a homogeneous system, the second term is unimportant because it's the same energy, irrespective of where the particles are. And the last term is just a total particle number times the chemical potential. This is the term that you get in the canonical ensemble to look at how many particles you have affects the system. And we'll talk more about this term in the next lecture or so. And then the only thing that we need is the tunnelling term. It's basically saying, OK, how likely is it or how fast is it? What is the rate for particles going from one site to the next?
[eqn, eqn]
And this is not a full Hamiltonian to describe single particles in the lowest band of an optical lattice. And the next challenge will be to look into interactions in this Hamiltonian. And if we add those, then we end up with the full Bose-Hubbard model. What you can see now here on this plot is the molecular potential between two atoms. You basically see the potential energy $V$ as a function of the distance between two particles. And these molecular potentials, they're obviously pretty complicated. And that gives rise to the richness of molecular physics. We now need to find a very simplified description of this that we can use to study manybody physics. For this, it's important to think a little bit about these potentials.
[pic]
On the one hand, for long distances here, you have a Van der Waals interaction
[eqn]
because this is an induced dipole interaction at large distances, because the atoms are both electrically neutral. The minimum distance of this potential here, what the distance of the minimum is on the order of 10 angstrom. A few nanometres at most. And then we have a very a fast rising potential on the insite, which is the exchange interaction at small distances. Simply said, if the atoms get very, very close to each other, the electron clouds start to overlap. And then both the Pauli principle and also the Coulomb interaction between the electrons means that there must be a very strong repulsion. The crucial thing to see here is the typical distances are very, very small. And in fact, the range of this potential is really important, is typically much, much, much smaller than both the de Broglie wavelengths of the particles (because the particles are very slow, because we are very cold temperatures) and the typical distance between the particles. Basically, if you want all of our physics happens on this scale. But then the interactions length is much, much, much, much shorter. And that gives rise to a very, very strong simplification which is basically saying that we can replace the real potential by an effective contact potential. The particles only interact if they are at the same position.
[eqn]
And in the future we mostly talk about different regimes, meaning different scattering lengths are positive, negative and so on. If I take a typical BEC, for instance, Rubidium 87, one of the easiest atoms to condensate. I have a scattering length on the order of 100 Angstrom, and the Bohr radius $a_0$ is half an angstrom, more or less.

The other thing that's very important and very powerful for cold atoms is that very often we can use so-called Feshbach resonances to tune this $a$ by changing the magnetic field. We just apply a different magnetic field and we can get a different $a$ (scattering length). The effects are important in molecular physics, and I'm not going to go into details here for the sake of time, but you can think of this very often, that the magnetic field is just a joining up with which you can join the sign and the strength of the interaction. You can have not interacting atoms with parts of attractive, strongly interacting, weakly interacting atoms just by dialling one of the features. It doesn't work for all atoms but for many cases. Like, for instance, potassium atoms where you have nice resonances where you can really tune the interaction at will.

OK. How can we now take this and introduce this into our Hamiltonian, which we have written down in second quantised notation. If I take the general case of a generic two-particle interaction term, the energy is given by half the integral over all of space for the position of particle one, and all of space for a position of particle two. And then I have my two particles. What we do is we effectively destroy the particles at these two positions and then we create the particles. Now in this case at the same positions.
[eqn]
if I have two particles at the positions $r$ and $r'$, then their interaction energy is given by the potential $V(r-r')$. And this term, of course, can be pretty complicated and can be pretty unwieldy, too, to use. But we can simplify it a lot because we can say, okay, we go to this effective potential.
[eqn]
We say we use a contact potential $g\delta^3 (r-r')$ in 3D, which simplifies things a lot because that basically removes one of those integrals over $r'$. And we're basically left with
[eqn: G halftimes integral over R Dega upsite. Dega upsite upsite.]
it basically says only when two particles are at the same position would they have an interaction energy $g$. The half is there because they have two operators and therefore can have two possibilities of how I can have these two particles. It cancels out if I have this indistinguishibility argument.


OK. And now we want to describe this generic interaction term in our bases of Wannier functions. You're basically saying, destroying a particle at position $r$ is the same as destroying a particle in a superposition of all of those $a_{i,n}$ weighted by the Wannier function at this potential.
[eqn]
And as I said before, the Wannier functions are a full, complete, orthonormal basis which can express everything. Also, the $\delta$-function as a superposition of all of those Wannier functions. We can do this and we get a term that's quite a bit more unwieldy again, because now we still have our integral over $\psi^+ \psi^+ \psi \psi$, and each of those terms have been expressed as a sum of all of those Wannier functions with the creation annihilation operators.
[eqn]
And this term is, of course, pretty unwieldy, and the main point to see from this term is that because you have different $n$ in here, because you have one independent $n$ and independent $r_i$ for each of the four operators that you have to put in. It tells us that the interactions can, in principle, couple different bands and lattice sites.

Here's the unwieldy term again. And now we simplify it again because we retain the biggest term only, and the biggest term is the one where all of the $i$s are the same and the $n$s are the same. In addition, we assume that the particles are all in the lowest band, that only the lowest band is occupied. And then we can basically say, okay, well, instead of having all of those sums over $i$ and $n$, we only have one sum over $i$.
[eqn]
And this is now neat, because if we now have the points that all of the Wannier functions around all of lattice sites are the same, it simplifies even further because we can basically and say which lattice site to look at doesn't matter, and you can define a new constant $U=g\int d^3 \vec{r} |w_0(\vec{r}|^4$. And then the last thing that we want to deal with this,
[eqns]
And for this, we just have to remember that $a$ and $a \dagger$ are bosonic operators. The commutator equals one. I can basically white this now as
[eqn]
which means in total, the interaction energy for bosons in an optical lattice is given by
[eqn]
It depends on your Wannier function; the bigger it is in the middle, the bigger the integral becomes. And this is now a very simple result. It makes sense to think about it a little bit. $n_i$ is the number of atoms on site $i$ and what it basically tells us is that each of the atoms on lattice site $i$ will interact with the $n-1$ other atoms and at the site. Now, because the particles are indistinguishable, the interaction of particles 1 with 3 and 3 or 1 is the same thing, so we have a $1/2$ for double counting.

You might want to know, how does this play out for thousands of particles? And the answer is very simple. If you have many, many particles in the same mode, you basically get that the interaction energy just goes as $n^2$ which is consistent with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. But if you go down to very small numbers, remember it's an operator; it is really the projection of the particle numbers that you get. Then the quantised nature of the particle number is important.

The next step now for us is to simply combine all of those resutls that we have and write down the full Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. here we have it:
[eqn]
The first term is the kinetic energy (derived last lecture). The second term is the interaction energy that we have just derived. The third term is the local potential energy, which is relevant if and only if the on-site energy depends on $i$. So, for instance, if you have a trap. But it can very often be neglected. And the last term is the chemical potential times total particle number which is only relevant in a grand canonical ensemble and I talk about this again a bit later.

When is this the valid Hamiltonian to describe our system? Firstly we need a reasonably deep lattice. We need to be in this tight binding limit, which basically just means that lattice depth needs to be at least $5E_r$, which is easy to achieve. The second one is we need to have not too strong interactions because remember, we made this approximation that we took out all of those terms which couple different bands. We were basically just looking at the biggest terms and the one is a good approximation if the scattering length $a$ is much smaller than the lattice constant (typically a couple of hundred nanometres), or equivalently I can also say that the interaction energy should be much, much smaller than the bandgap.

Basically what this means is that both requirements are typically fulfilled with ultracold atoms and therefore optical lattices are accurate implementations of the Bose-Hubbard model (and later on, the Fermi-Hubbard).

Now let's look at the ground states of this model. Let's take a BH model and neglect the last term here, and say that I have a fixed filling. And very often in quantum mechanics, you know, have two opposite terms. You have the kinetic energy term and the interaction, and you can ask yourself which term will dominate? And well, if you go into different regimes, you will get different answers. If you first start in the case where the interaction energy is zero and $t>0$, this is the noninteracting limit. And there we already know it would be a superfluid. It would be a BEC. In this case, we only have kinetic energy. 
[eqn]
And if you look at that state in various descriptions, you will find that the state is a superfluid state. It has off-diagonal long range order because it is a BEC state and it is phase coherent. Now we take all of those concepts from the phase transitions lecture (long range order, phase coherence, ODLRO) and they all apply to this BEC. If we now do experiments, if we measure this BEC in a lattice, what do we get? Well, if we measure in momentum space, we get a momentum distribution. It looks like this.
[pic]
We have the typical BEC peak of zero momentum and we have the satellite peaks that we discussed in the last lecture, $\pm 2\hbar k$ in both the $x$ as well as in the $y$ direction, and some higher order terms. And that's a consequence because we now don't have condensation in plane waves, but condensation of Bloch waves. If we were to look, and we can do this with a quantum gas microscope, locally and ask how many atoms do I see on each lattice site, you will get something that will look very disordered because each particle, each atom is delocalised over the whole lattice. It actually will follow a poissonian distribution. 

If I take the other limit, if I take the limit of infinitely strong repuslive interaction $U>0, t=0$ then we will be in a Mott Insulating state. Now if if you want to minimise your energy, you have to minimise the interaction energy, which basically means you just have to go out of each other's way. You should never put more than one particle on the lattice site. If I have in total as many particles as I have lattice sites, I am filling one, then basically what I get is a state where I put exactly one particle into each lattice site and that's it.
[eqn]
where $n$ in this case, it's the filling factor. If we have any $n=1$ it just means that you put one particle in each lattice site. If you have this "commensurate filling", you have as many particles as you have lattice sites, that's the ground state that you will get. If you look at that state in momentum space (next lecture) because each particle is localised to an individual site in real space, you get a very broad momentum distribution. The state is insulating because the particles are localised so they cannot conduct. The state is also incompressible. The superfluid state is very compressible because you can always put more atoms in. This state is very incompressible. It's a gapped state because if you now want to put another particle in this state, this particle will necessarily have to sit on top of an already existing particle, so will have to pay this extra interaction energy. And because all particles are now localised, there's no long range phase coherence. The matter wave field and left hand side now has nothing to do with the matter wave fields on the right hand site. The picture for this state is that each atom as localised to a single site. And this state can only exist for commensurate filling, which means the number of atoms divided by the number of lattice sites is an integer.
[pic, eqn]
If you have, say, one point two atoms per site, then you will always have a few excess particles on top of this MI background, and they are free to move around because they pay the same interaction energy everywhere. And then the whole state will turn into a superfluid. 

What I should point out is that so far we've only discussed the limits. We've only discussed the limit where either we have noninteracting particles or we are strictly localised particles where the kinetic energy is zero. We will see in that these are only valid in these two limits; they really connect all the way up to some point in the middle where we have a quantum phase transition from a superfluid into a Mott insulator. if I take a MI and I put in some kinetic energy, the state fundamentally will remain a MI, but the wave function would be far more complicated than the simple one here. The transition in the BH model was for the first time observed in an experiment close to 20 years ago by Marcus Greiner, Tilman Esslinger, Immanuel Bloch and others. And that was really the starting point for this whole business of quantum simulators. And this paper is also the first paper that we look at in the journal club. 

Let's start to describe these states a bit more quantitatively and try to understand them a little bit more. And let's start with this MI in the limit of a positive interaction energy but the kinetic energy is zero. That limit is typically called the "atomic limit". In this case, the full Hamiltonian that we have is just interaction energy 
[eqn]
And so now we should think a little bit more about what this chemical potential term actually means. We're thinking in the grand canonical ensemble and we're saying that $\mu = \partial E / \partial N$ at $T=0$ (or constant entropy). It's telling you how much energy will the state gain if you add another particle? A slightly simplified but rather good analogy is to say, if I have a battery with a certain voltage here and I put two leads into my system, will it try to give electrons into the system or not? Well, if the voltage or chemical potential of the battery is higher than that of the system, it will drive more particles in there until the chemical potential of my system is as big as the one off my battery. It's a convenient parameter for us to see how the atom number behaves in certain limits. Let's make a little truth table for this interaction term and ask what is the interaction energy that we have for different particle numbers? 
[table, pic]
Here's basically the same thing that I have said just now written down. This plot of density as a function of chemical potential now consists of sharp steps. If you're in a state with $n=1$ and you have this type of Hamiltonian up here, then you're in this MI state, and you ask what's the probability of finding one particle on the lattice site? That's exactly one. 

Another thing we can ask about this MI in the atomic limit is we can ask about the excitation spectrum. Will it be gapless, so it can have very cheap excitations? Or will it be gapped, so we have to pay a certain amount of energy to create an excitation? If you think about the $n=1$ state, and you want to change the state in any way, then you realise that the lowest energy version you can do is take one particle at moving and all of its neighbour. That's the smallest excitation you can do. And this excitation will cost energy $U$, because now you suddenly have one that's doubly occupied. What we say is that this excitation creates one double occupancy, the double occupied site, and a hole: a \textbf{doublon-holon pair}.

How do we describe these states? In second quantised notation, that's actually rather simple. We take the states and each lattice site and we can describe them as Fock states (number states). 
[eqns]
The Fock states cannot interfere with anything because they carry no phase information whatsoever. Basically the expectation value of the field operator $\langle\psi \rangle = 0$, even though the expectation value $\langle \psi^2 \rangle$ is non-zero. 

And now the MI in the atomic limit. Again, I'm stressing in the atomic limit; out of this, it will be more complicated; is just described by a product of local Fock states. It is the product of all sites.


Let's now look at the few properties of the noninteracting limit. The wave function is that each atom is in the same state, with a macroscopic occupation of a single particle ground state of the Bloch wave. And if you now ask again about the local distribution of particle numbers, you realise that each of the $n$ particles has an equal chance to be found in any of the lattice sites because the Bloch waves are spread out evenly over the whole system. This then means that local atom number follows a multinomial distribution. This is basically a generalisation of the binomial distribution. If you would have $n$ particles and spread them out over two lattice sites, then you would have a binomial distribution. And that would predict you how likely it would be to find how many atoms on each of the lattice sites. If you have many sites, it's sort of a binomial you can imagine normal distribution. This one looks, of course, a bit more complicated. The point is that this can be simplified to a product of Poisson distributions on each lattice site. Strictly speaking, that's true in a grand canonical ensemble, where a total atom number does not need to be conserved. 
[pic]
But it's not so important at this stage. What's important is that we really expect a distribution that looks this. Now it's a poissonian distribution on each lattice site. If you have an average atom number of one in a superfluid state, you have a high probability of finding one atom. But you have equally high probability of finding zero atoms on another site. And that's compensated for by a smaller probability of finding two, three, four or even more atoms on this lattice site. 

The next thing is that it's obvious that in the noninteracting case, the system must have gapless excitation. The reason is that each particle, sits in a single particle ground state, but the single particle ground state has a continuous dispersion relation $\epsilon (q)$. Basically I can take any of the particles in the BECs and create an excitation, where this particle was modified to a small finite momentum. Because the dispersion is continuous, these are gapless. And for the experts that have done the AOP course wit Zoran last term, this is like the Bogoliubov spectrum. 
[eqn]
These excitations, I can then think of collective exhortations like density waves or phonons, but still they are gapless. 

Okay. The other way I can describe his poissonian distributions is to realise that the multinomial distribution will factorise into local coherent states. And they're basically given by a superposition of the Fock states, characterised by an complex number $\alpha$,
[eqn]
where the coherent states have been introduced as the eigenstates of the annihilation operator. And these states are very crucial in, for instance, quantum optics because they are the states that correspond to coherent classical light fields. So this complex number $\alpha$ encodes something that classically corresponds to the amplitude and the phase of a classical field. They are also crucial for us, if you think of matter-wave optics, because they are states that locally have a phase. If you calculate their number distribution, that's something that's easy to calculate, you ask, what's the probability of finding any particles in such a coherent state? And these are all calculations that you've done last year. 
[eqn]
Turns out to be a poissonian distribution where the average particle number for a state alpha is just given by 
[eqn]
[ODLRO eqn]
we really have ODLRO. What this means is that, as I said before, the superfluid state is a ordered state. It's a state with a broken symmetry, this phase DOF is broken. 

Now we can have a better understanding of the two limits, we can now ask whether you can also say something about the whole phase diagram in between? And the answer is yes, we can, because we can start by saying that the superfluid has a broken symmetry. We just discussed that it has this order, and the MI does not have a broken symmetry, which means that these two limits have been this must be separated by a quantum phase position at some critical point $(U/J)_C$ and it cannot be a cross over. 
[pic]
And the first thing I can plot is the excitation energy. I can say, what is the size of the gap, the lowest excitation energy? If the system is gapped, then for a large $U/J$ I would have an interaction energy on the order of $U$. This gap will decay down to zero at the critical point. But the lowest excitation that we can do becomes gapless, as previously discussed. The lowest excitation energy must be zero. And for very large $U/J$, we just scale like $U$. Closer to the critical point it must change in a more complicated manner because it must vanish in the gapless superfluid. All of this we can just say by thinking about what we know about from these
limits and that there must be a phase submission in between. 

The other thing we can plot is the order parameter. 
[pic] 
We can plot the limit of $r_i - r_j$ going to infinity. We know that in the unordered phase, in the MI it is zero. And then it would come up in the superfluid side.
We know that this would be a continuous phase transition. And this is now what we call a quantum phase transition, which is driven by quantum fluctuations and not thermal fluctuations. It just means for us now that it happens in the ground state at $T=0$. And how does this look in experiment? Well, that's mostly something that you would see in the journal club this week where we can talk about this also in more detail.
