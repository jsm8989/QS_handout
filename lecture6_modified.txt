Hello and welcome back. We are continuing with bosons in lattices. We're going to look at this phase diagram of the Bose Hubbard model in more detail. We're going to calculate some critical interaction strength. And then in the end, also look at how this can actually be measured.

In the BH Hamiltonian, we said that the first term is the kinetic energy, where $t$ is the tunnelling rate or hopping rate (also called $J$), and it's the speed with which particles can hop from one lattice site to the next, and then hopping is only between nearest neighbours. The interaction term is a purely on site interaction, so particles only interact if there's more than one particle on the same lattice site. And if you have $n$ particles on it, each of those particles can interact with $n-1$ partners. And in total, you have a factor of one half in here because of double counting.

For the first part of this lecture, we can ignore the onsite energies which are only relevant if you have a trapped system; will come back to that at the end. And we note that we can control the overall density of the particles with the chemical potential by working in the grand canonical ensemble. What we discussed last time was that we have two different types of ground states. And as a reminder, if we are in the limit of having no interactions with $U=0$, we have a superfluid state and the superfluid state in this limit can be described as just saying is it a BEC, condensing into the $q=0$ quasi-momentum mode of the lowest band. And that basically means that each particle can be described as being in a superposition of all of the sites. This means if I look at this in momentum space, I get sharp peaks because all of the particles acquire momentum and we see the high order peaks. If I look in real space, the local particle number has a broad distribution because every particle by chance would be projected onto one of the lattice sites, and by chance you will find one, two or three particles on this lattice site. And last time we discussed how you can describe this with local coherent states and how you get a poissonian distribution. That's the superfluid regime. And each atom is delocalised over the whole lattice.

The other phase, is the Mott insulator phase. And again, this expression is only about it, in the limit were $t=0$ and $U>0$. The so-called atomic limit where it has no kinetic energy whatsoever. And then we are saying, if I have on average one particle per lattice site, I will get a state that is a product of Fock states where put exactly one atom on each lattice site. And we also said that these two regimes are not connected by some crossover, but there is really a phase transition between them. There is some critical $U_C$ where you have a sudden jump from the superfluid state into the MI state. What I should say is that the expressions that we see here, are really only valid in the limits above, and if you want to do a precise calculation, you have to resort to heavyweight metrics like, for instance, quantum Monte Carlo methods. Let's think about this phase diagram. Think about the point that we have these two phases, superfluid and Mott insulator. And we note that the MI only exists for commensurate filling. If you want to draw an approximate phase diagram, you would come up with a diagram like this.
[pic]
We can think about first, maybe about the limits $t=0$. That's the limit that we've discussed in detail last lecture where we said, okay, I have a positive chemical potential. I can minimise my free energy by putting particles in the system. The density will rise, but it will only rise up to the point of density one, an $n=1$ insulator where particles will never meet. I have no interaction energy to pay. I cannot put particles on top of each other in this regime because my chemical potential is less than the interaction energy unit. I would have to pay to put two particles in the same site. Of course changes exactly at this point to a $\mu=U$, and then suddenly the minimum free energy is for $n=2$. Because now suddenly if I put in one particle, I have to pay into each energy one $U$. But again, the chemical potential is bigger than $U$. Then of course I want to put into particles. And similarly here I have to step up to three to step up to four. As we discussed last weak, the superfluid can exist at all densities. But the MI only at this discrete commensurate ones. These dashed lines show the evolution of what a constant density would do. 

Which chemical potential gives rise to a constant density? If we think about the first line, we can have $n=1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5...2$ and then from 2 to 3 to whatever the continuum of densities that we can have in the second. But if you now move towards the Mott insulators, and that's  what these lines here indicate, then if I'm really at density one, I will go straight into the Mott insulator there. But if I say I am at density 1.2, why can't we form a Mott insulator? Because I have 20 percent too many atoms I will have to follow this line bending upwards and I will have to avoid the insulator and end up somewhere in between the lobes. Of course if the system has a chance of absorbing more atoms or getting rid of excess atoms because it's connected to a reservoir, as you would really expect it to be in a grand canonical ensemble, then the system will now either go into the $n=1$ or $n=2$ Mott insulator and the numbers will be made up with the reservoir. 

Let's try to understand a little bit more the shape of this, why do we have these domes here? Well, the argument you can make is that if $U>>t$ we are very close to the y-axis. We've been talking exactly about the point here, where $\mu = U$. Or you could have $\mu =2U$, if we said exactly at this point in between the lobes, then of course there's a degeneracy in the free energy because both $\bar{n}=J+1$ or $\bar{n}=J$ is possible. The same holds between two higher lobes. I will get a big effect even with a small tunnelling. And it will go into the superfluid phase. Why do I say I'm sitting somewhere here where everything's solid? 

Why would we expect these lobe structures where it starts off this? Another thing that we can see is that the lobes get smaller as we go higher up the y-axis. We can understand this intuitively by saying that we have Bosonic tunnelling and that means we have \textbf{bosonic enhancement}. That means if there are already three or four or five bosons on the lattice site, hopping goes faster. And again, a smaller tunnelling can have a bigger effect. Think of the first term in the Hamiltonian operating on, say, $|n\rangle$ and you can see it.

OK, the last question we can ask is where is the tip of the lobe. It would be in the vicinity of $\mu = U/2$ so in the middle of the slope. But the question is, where is this critical $U/t$. At which point do we expect this one to change from Mott insulator into superfluid? And in order to answer this, we have to do a little bit of theory. And we'll do this in the easiest possible way. We will use mean field theory. If you think about this fundamentally, the problem you have is say you want to understand what's going on in this lattice. But this lattice site is, of course, coupled with the tunnel couplings to its neighbours. You can't really solve the problem for this one without having solve the problems with the neighbouring sites beforehand, because we really need to know how many atoms are there? Are you likely to hop onto the next site or not? So no site can be solved individually. And that is, as I said already, what makes the manybody problem hard. But you can now say, if I have quite a few of those neighbours, I can make an approximation where we place all of those couplings from a given site to all of its surroundings by an average or an effective interaction with  what we call the mean field. Pictorially speaking, we are going from the left to the right image 
[left pic, mean field right pic]
And this is a very strong simplification because it reduces the many body problem into an effective one body or single site problem. I should say that is, of course, much, much easier to deal with. What we need to do then is we need to find the value of this mean-field. And it needs to be found self-consistently. It's an approximate scheme because you only have these four neighbours in this case and these are not infinitely many. There will be fluctuations around the average and these fluctuations are important. Very often these theories only become exact in the limit of infinitely many neighbours, in infinitely many dimensions. In 3-D where we have six neighbours in a simple cubic lattice, it should be better than in 2D, and that would be even better than in 1D, because in 1D we only have two neighbours, and the fluctuations would be very, very important. 

Okay, let's try to do this calculation. As I said, it's very approximate, but therefore it's also easy to handle and even me as an experimentalist can present it. The starting point is to say if I take a quantum mechanical operator, a I can replace that by its expectation value plus the remaining fluctuations. Let's take our BEC and describe it as a product of local coherent states.
[eqn]
The operator we're looking at is the annihilation operator. And then we're going to say, well, if we can describe this one as a coherent state, the expectation value $\langle a_i \rangle $ is no problem. And then of course, there's the remaining part, the fluctuations.
[eqn]
And what we can do is just to simplify things as we assume that we have a homogeneous system. And we're assuming that if there is a mean field, if there is something happening, then it's going to be condensation into the zero momentum mode. That's, of course, obviously a very reasonable assumption. And if we say it's $q=0$, then
[eqn]
Please note that if we do this calculation and it tells us that the self-consistent meanfield we get is finite, then this implies ODLRO. The only thing that we can have is no order at all or full long range order where all sites are doing the same thing because of the simplifications that we've made. So far, everything just has been a restatement of things in a slightly different language. Now the approximation part comes in this line where we say, okay, we can now try to take some fluctuations, in particular, what we want to do is we want to declare terms on the order of fluctuations squared
[eqn]
What we're basically saying is if I take two times an operator minus expectation value, I would set that to zero. This is a formal thing that we're doing. We're not saying we neglecting all the fluctuations that would be too harsh and would mean that we would never get something. But we're saying we neglecting the product of fluctuations. 
[eqn]
This is called the \textbf{decoupling approximation} and is important because now what you see here is that the sites, I and J are not directly coupled. Nothing covert sites are in J anymore. It's just that both the sites I couple to the mean at the site J. And if we now say we take this one and go with this one into the Bose Hubbard Hamiltonian 
[eqn]
We just have to ask, how many nearest neighbours do we have? And that's the coordination number. And the key thing is that even though this expression was longer than expressions we had before for the Hamiltonian, this is now a purely local problem of a single site which is coupled to a mean average field. The complexity is far, far, reduced. We realised that we are mostly interested in the phase transition, and from superfluid to MI is a continuous phase transition, which means that the expectation value would be very small, close to the transition. On the Mott side, there would be zero. And on the superfluid side it would start to take off from zero. We're  interested in this position where it changes from being zero to being nonzero. 
[eqn]
We can do the following. We can expand the free energy as a function of $|\psi|$. We know that we'll get 
[eqn]
and there cannot be linear or cubic terms because the symmetry of the lattice. And it's not shown here, but $b$ will always be positive, so the question of whether $a$ is positive or negative is important. If $a>0$, we basically get something that's a parabola down here, 
[pic]
while if $a<0$ we get the sombrero potential. In the plus situation, there is no mean field, meaning there is no superfluid, there is no ODLRO. With the other case there is a mean field, there is ODLRO, and this is the superfluid phase. You will accept this continuous symmetry breaking and you can be either here or there at any point around this ring. The symmetry is the phase of $\psi$ and it can be spontaneously broken by going from the MI to the
superfluid.

The only thing left to do is to calculate this does point of order as $a=0$. And this can be done easily numerically, or it can even be done in second order perturbation theory. And the answer is that if you do this at the tip of the $n=1$ Mott lobe, you get a value $U/zt=5.83$. So now we understand where the critical point would be in this very approximate mean field theory. This five point eight three is, of course, independent of dimension because the only effect of dimensionality is to control $z$. But the question is, is this true? Is it okay to neglect all of the other things and to just look at this mean field theory?
[pic - table]
And as already alluded to, it's okay in high dimensions, but very much not okay in low dimensions. Well, what's going on here is that MFT is always pretty good in 3D and it's even better in higher dimensions. And it will typically, in almost all cases, overestimate the ordered phase - It favours the ordered phases. If people do more in-depth analysis later on, they typically first look at the mean field analysis, and if this tells you that there is not going to be any ordered phase it's unlikely but not impossible to find one. You have to then take quantum fluctuations into account. 
[eqn]
Not relevant for us mostly, but for the experts in 1D strictly speaking you never have a proper order parameter;
[expectation that your PSI will always be zero]
You don't really get long range order. You only get quasi long range orders, and that means that the phase transitions will be of a particular type, the so-called Kosterlitz-Thouless type.


Local density approximation
Of course, many experiments are not done in big homogeneous lattice, but in an underlying harmonic trap that keeps all of the atoms together. And that means that the situation might be very different. What we typically do is we do something called the \textbf{local density approximation}, where we are saying in principle, I have my underlying harmonic trap, 
[pic]
And then you can ask, what can I learn from the homogeneous system and use it for the inhomogeneous system? And the answer is that I can say take this area of the trap where a potential is more or less constant, we just say that in here and in this little box, we assume that the trapping potential is going to be constant. And then $\mu$ as well, which, of course, is the problem parameter. We approximate our inhomogeneous system by a sequence of such boxes.
[eqn - LDA]
And then we can ask, if I now have a bunch of particles in this overall harmonic trap, how will these particles distribute themselves over those boxes? And because we're doing the calculation already in the grand canonical ensemble, it's actually rather easy to take this into account, because we're basically saying each box will be filled up with its own chemical potential and the chemical potential in a given box (in a given position) is given as above.
[eqn]
So you're really saying that because this box is higher up here, it will have a lower chemical potential, so therefore less particles will want to go into this box; and then in equilibrium, what you get is you get that you have the same chemical potential everywhere and the particles have  arranged themselves in such a way that they minimise the total energy. 

As a quick reminder, what again is the chemical potential in a grand canonical ensemble? It's defined as the derivative of the total energy with respect to particle number at constant entropy. 
[eqn for mu and normalisation] 
I take this density and integrate this density over the whole trip. Then of course I need to get the correct for particle number. This basically determines $\mu_0$. This picture is, of course, very simple in a sense, because you never have to solve the inhomogeneous system. You just need a good solution for a homogeneous system. And then you basically just say, okay, I know ever which this one over my trap and they end up where I want. Very often it is okay for us.

What does this mean for the situation that we have now with bosons in an optical lattice? And this is basically something that gives rise to the following set of diagrams and to the famous wedding cake structure of photons in an optical lattice.
[pic]
What we said about the chemical potential is we say that the chemical potential at a given point in trap is the central chemical potential minus the trapping potential at this point. Going back to the phase diagram, then if we have a certain $\mu_0$, say, in the centre of the trap, we might be at this position. This basically means if I look at this in 2D from the top, I would expect that in the centre of the trap for this set of parameters, I have an $n=2$ MI, which is then surrounded by a SF shell with density varying from two to one, which is surrounded by $n=1$ Mott insulating shell. And then again, it's surrounded by a superfluid wing with the density going from zero from one to zero.
[pic - 3D cakes]
Okay, as you would expect from here, the first thing that melts is the $n=3$ plateau. And then if we look further, we see if we go for a small $U/t$ the MI fully goes away and you basically just have this inverted parabola that you really know from BECs. 

On the next slide are now going to show you a little bit how we can try to calculate these pictures theoretically, how we can analyse them in a better way and how we get quantitative information about the physics from these pictures. 
[tof images]
For this, let's think about the time of flight from a let us again, but thinking about it in a different way. Last time we said, think about the individual particles and say they have a certain velocity and then they fly with this velocity and that's where we can see the particles and after time of flight. Now we take a very different approach. We're thinking about this really in the theoretical approach if you want. Here's my lattice. And I have, like, little matter wave packets on each lattice site. And if I switch off the lattice that these wav packets will now spread out in free space, and they would start to overlap. And if there's no phase coherence between all of these different things, all of these waves coming from the different lattice sites cannot interfere, then they're basically just get a total density. We just the some of the density coming from the individual lattice site because we just this broad envelope. And that's what I would expect in a deep Mott insulator where there's no correlations, no coherence between lattice sites. If I'm on the other hand, in a superfluid regime with ODLRO, I get interference and I get something that's a diffraction experiment. You can really think of this as a multi slit. And the typical thing that you think about then is to have a long time of flight, then this becomes Fraunhofer diffraction. We have this interference and therefore we see the sharp peaks here. And the sharpness of the peaks directly tells us something about how many lattice sites must have been coherent; if these peaks are very sharp it means we have a coherence over very long distance. On the other hand, in the MI, I have no coherence, I have no interference, and I have no peaks. And I basically just see this envelope.
[pic - enevelope]

And this we can now also calculate analytically and for this we use the field operators in momentum space, 
[eqn - derivation.]
Let's take these field operators in real space and truncate them to the lowest band, and express them in the Wannier basis.  And then the next step we can do is we can just change the indexing. We can say we define a new coordinate 
$$r' = r-r_i$$
And the other thing we did is we took this sum and took it out of the integral.
[result]
This expression involves the FT of the Wannier function, so we can write in the compact form
[form]
using the field operator in momentum space. What we're measuring is, of course, the density momentum space. Because we're measuring many, many particles at the same time, we just see the expectation value. And if you plug both things in, what we get is the following simple expression 
[eqn]
And this is already our final result. It basically tells us that the momentum distribution that we can measure is given by a tiny envelope with just a Fourier transform of the Wannier function, times a structure factor which depends on the state and the lattice. If you think of the Wannier function in the deep lattice as being akin to a Gaussian, then this looks a two dimensional Gaussian as it should. If you have something where you have ODLRO, the structure factor is very non-trivial. And it basically gives rise to these delta peaks you would expect.

[experimental slide - visibility $v=(w-b)/(w+b)$]
Just for clarity, it becomes even more interesting if I take this data and plot them now on the log-log plot, because then you can see that there's decay of the visibility in the Mott insulator actually follows a very simple power law;
[eqn]
And that's something that we can try to understand again analytically.

In the atomic limit and $n=1$ the wavefunction is a product of Fock states and 
[eqn - $\langle a^\dagger_i a_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$]
Also, the whole structure factor is a constant, which of course means that the visibility vanishes. If we now go one step further and take perturbation theory around the atomic limit, we assume that $U/t$ is large but finite. 
[eqn - PT derivation]
And now we can see that this one is a little bit nicer if the sum would give all states $k$ over the Hilbert space. This can be done, so 
[eqn - resolution of identity]
And then the next thing I need to know is what is this value of the denominator? I have one doublon in there, which means that the energy will be increased by one factor of $U$, then we get the result
[eqn - \phi_1 and the following line]
It means that if I have some finite tunnelling, not all particles would be pinned onto individual sites, but we get an admixture of higher order terms. Whenever you have two sites, you would say, OK, a dominant contribution is one particle per site, but there's always a small admixture of having one doublon-holon in here. And what this means is that the local atom number has acquired quantum fluctuations. Even if you're very close to an extreme state of the one term,
it would be prudent a little bit by the of her term because that term doesn't compute with the first time.
This broadening of the distribution is called quantum fluctuations. 

In a concrete example: the interaction term would say you want to have exactly one particle at the site. That's it. And then you would measure everywhere one and would never measure anything else. And you would not have fluctuations in the particle number. But because of the presence of the non-commuting part of the Hamiltonian, the kinetic energy, you get a small admixture of having no particle there or two particles. The local atom number has acquired quantum fluctuations. And it turns out if you now plug this into the visibility calculation, you get the visibility actually decays. 
[eqn]
