So you have the Fermi Hubbard model you get similar to the bosonic case, just that you need to have two different spin states of the fermions in order to have interactions. Otherwise, Pauli blocking means there is no interactions. And that, of course, means that you have a very, totally new thing because you have magnetism to play with. If you take the atomic limit, $U>0, t=0, U>>k_BT$, we now have to talk also about temperature in a slightly different way because we now have to say there's different hierarchies of temperature scales. In this case you don't have enough time and energy to put two particles on one site, then at any one you must have this product of Fock states, that is the only possible solution. That's very similar to what we did in the Bosonic case. Now with the fermions, we have this huge degeneracy of the spins because we can have all different spin patterns in here. But for bosons the easiest case you can do is just put one party in every little site and then you have to have a model already; but for fermions, if you were to have just one spin state, then you just have basically a boring band insulator. 

OK, so if you do this, how many possible combinations of states do you have? Well, the answer is simple, and you have a factor of two for each lattice site because you can put a spin up or down there, so you get in total two, three and other combinations. Which means that the entropy capacity, the maximum entropy that you can put on each lattice site, is $\log 2$ per particle. And then the question you can ask and in the atomic limit, all of those configurations are totally degenerate because there is no communication between the different lattice, so they're all, strictly speaking, absolutely degenerate. Any finite $t$ will break this degeneracy and you can ask which of this configuration will be the ground state. Or maybe it will be something totally different, and which Hamiltonian will describe this low energy spin physics? And that's what we're going to develop today and going to see that this is going to be the Heisenberg model. 

The first intuition that we can start is by saying, let's do second order perturbation theory in $t$, like we did also with the bosonic case, because we can say that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle means that if we can delocalise the particles a little bit, that will lower the kinetic energy. And in the process you have in mind, as you say, okay, what if I have two particles and two lattice sites (spin up here and down there), then by tunnelling, one can hop on top of the other. Now that process is of course detuned by an energy $U$, so you you won't want to do this, but if you think of the Second Order perturbation you can go to this intermediate state, which is determined by $U$ and go back to the original state. Calculate the energy shift that you get
[eqn - 2PT]
as a consequence of this. And then you realise you get many, many, many terms. But they all have the same structure.
They are proportional to $t^2$ because this is always going one hopping. There is no$ \sqrt{2}$ or something here because it's fermions, so no bosonic enhancement. All of these energy differences will all be because they are something where you start with atoms, a neighbouring site and one atom somewhere in this chain. Think of an infinite chain. It could be this atom hopping on top of its neighbour. Or it could be that atom popping on top of its neighbour could happen anywhere. But it happens exactly once because we're just doing second order. And that means that the energy to create is just exactly $U$, so this whole thing was collected squared over you. 

And then you can ask how many of these processes are possible? And is that something that distinguishes different configurations? And the answer is yes, because if you have a configuration where you have two identical spins on neighbouring sites, then the Pauli principle forbids this. In a sense, the detuning in this case is not $U$, it's the band gap to the next band because if this particle wants to hop on it has to go to the first excited state in that site. And that's a very big energy. And we say this just doesn't happen. The ground state will be the one that maximises the number of pairs of orthogonal spins on neighbouring lattice sites. And what this means is this is going to favour antiferromagnetic order. 

And the next thing I should say is that everything I thought I talked so far is an oversimplification because what we are picking a direction. And that's  the language that you use for the Ising model. And that's not adequate to you to see this. Let's go back and look at the FH model and look at the symmetry. 
[eqn - fh hamiltonian]
You see that these operators now have an index sigma, which is the spin index, so it can be spin up spin on the basis of the spin on it. The interesting thing is, now if I say spin up and spin down, we know that they are a conflict, a basis of the $SU(2)$ space, but you could also say it's been left, spin right, spin front and back. You can  take any two orthogonal states on the sphere and use them as a basis. Nothing will change. What you can do here is if these parameters of the strategy does not depend on sigma, then you can just go in and say, let's do a basis change that we replace up and down by spin left and spin right. If you do this, some of these two terms for two weak must become standard, some of the two terms for these terms. Which intuitively makes sense of a spin up particle, and it's been on particle if they hop tunnel in the same way, then the coherent superposition of up and down what also happened exactly the same way. I could also write it down its native hopping terms for spin and spin left. And the second term here means that we need two particles that can be on the same site to interact, so it must be something where I have one spin and you spin, it could be spin up and spin down. But if I take spin left and spin right, they also be orthogonal. You can take any of them on the basis of the spin one half Hilbert space, and you do not change the form of the Hamiltonian. The FH model is $SU(2)$ symmetric. 

OK. You can think of the point that because if I don't have a magnetic field, if I don't have anything external breaking symmetries, then what I point out is that axis is random could be an equipment in any direction. And this has profound consequences. This is the consequence when I write things down, in this form, up, down, up, down and down and all of these cartoons, they are strictly speaking wrong. The other cartoons that are correct for the Ising model, where we say the $z$ direction is special and it's spin can only point up or down, but it cannot point in any other direction. That's the Ising model can only point up or down. But in the model that we have here we have a different cemetery also. It also means we have a different cemetery that's been broken. The first spin can point in any direction. It's like a ferromagnet, they could all have a domain all pointing up. But I think we'll all be in the domain, pointing 45 degrees to the left or any other direction. And if we have a different symmetry being broken, the continuous symmetry in this case, that means that universality class of such a transition and many other things will be different. A lot of thinking can go into this lot of knowledge can be extracted without ever solving the problem, just by saying, OK, we know what's different compared to other models and the fun fact, and this is now getting incredibly complicated incredibly quickly, is that you cannot extend the symmetries of the FH model to more than two species. But you think about this on if you have these two spin states, which means you have to have a foreign component of our atoms. We can also choose three hyperfine components or four or five and so on. And normally, what you don't get is you get a not very symmetric model because normally what you get is if you say, I have been state. I will typically get that the interaction between my two spin states depends on which spin states I have. And then of course, that means that we have a problem about cemeteries and it's a very specific problem. However, you can also have the situation where the interaction does not depend on the spin states, but in all identical. And this, turns out, is something that you get, for instance, with things strontium or ytterbium, where you have a two outer electrons, because then very often what you get is that each electrons go into a spin singlet. You have no electronic spin, which means the spin sets of the atoms, if they talking about this, just a nuclear spin. And because the nucleus doesn't really take part in all of these  electronic exchange reactions, it means that whatever spin states the nucleus has, it doesn't change. Therefore you get to the interaction is the same independent of the spin state. And that's what people call an $SU(N)$ symmetric model. And if you look at those models, you can't think of them just as has a spin pointing in the direction, they have a more complex representation and we're not talking more about them in too much detail.

OK, so what is now an appropriate Hamiltonian to describe the exchange interaction that we had on the previous slide, the second order process of hopping back and forth. What kind of interaction would give us if we say we're just living in this in the Mott insulated space of one particle per site? And it turns out the spin model that comes out of this is the Heisenberg model. 
[eqn - Heisenberg plus pauli decomposition] 
The good thing about this model is that because you just have this scalar product here, it means it respects that $SU(2)$ symmetry because there is nothing in there that points out the direction. The only thing that's relevant is  a direction between two spins. If you make the connexion to the Hubbard model, you can formally show that the Heisenberg model is the low energy limit of this hubbard model for $n=1$ and $U>>t$. And it turns out that $J_{ex} = 4t^2/U$. And here again, there's a million different conventions. In the condensed matter context, they would typically call this exchange just as they typically call $J$, this is the day we exchange the hopping from one party to the next and second order perturbation theory. They would call this the exchange process. People in cold atoms started calling $J_{ex}$ because they say they use $J$ already for the bare hopping, which condensed matter people call $t$, which is inconvenient for cold atom people who work with time-dependent stuff. Positive $J$ gives antiferromagnetic order; Negative $J$ is also common in condensed matter physics, and that's when you get ferromagnetic systems.

OK. This model, even though is again very deceptively simple, can only be solved analytically in one dimension. Just to say, if I go to higher dimensions and think about simple cubic lattices and possible exchanges, you have a fermions than the ground State will always show antiferromagnetic long range order. The other parameter in this case is this little beast, which is the staggered magnetisation.
[eqn - m_s, define \phi_i]
This is maximised by the spins pointing in alternating directions. You can think of this as the analogue of normal magnetisation for the ferromagnetic case. Here's why things become so complicated. If you now think about the classical Ising model, it is pretty simple to maximise that, you get a local staggered magnetisation of one half. If I take the Heisenberg model and ride it out in components, what you have to think about is that what you want to do is now you want to maximise or minimise the sum of all of those three terms. You realise that the problem that you get is that if you say you have to minimise it. Maybe I can find a state that minimises the sum of these three terms even better by saying, let's not try to just minimise just one term, but try to minimise the sum of all of three of these terms at the same time. And if you try to do this by hand, you go crazy. This is why this model is not solvable in higher dimensions. What you can do is you can just say, Okay, let's try to solve this numerically. Let's use Quantum Monte Carlo and see what is the prediction. What will be the the perfect state? And the state is so complicated, it's so much entanglement, and it's that it's not easy to write it down. Even if you get an answer from Quantum Monte Carlo, it's so many times and they're so complicated that you can't easily write it down. But you can say is that if you include other terms, you get something where the staggered magnetisation is far less than this one half that you would expect from the Ising model. But if I take a 2d square lattice into Quantum Monte Carlo, I get $|m_s|\approx 0.31$ in the ground State, so the state is not that much spread out and ordered, as you would have thought from the classical state, but therefore it really minimises the sum of all three terms in the Hamiltonian. And this is this idea also was discussed last week, I hope the idea of quantum fluctuations. The way it becomes clear to me is by releasing, I take the sum of different terms which do not commute. And you know that the spin operators don't commute, right, so you can't take one ansatz that minimises all three times at the same time. So you have to find a compromise between them and his compromise seem to be a pretty complicated form. 

OK, so here we see that the Heisenberg model is very complicated, and we see that we get this, maybe intuitive but hard to predict answer of what the local staggered magnetisation will be. OK, so what this means is we have a phase transition in the middle, because we have asymmetry that's broken, we have an order parameter, it becomes non-zero. we have this transition of where we start off at, say, higher temperature still very small compared to $U$, where if is insulator entropy in the system dispensed to whatever they want to run the pattern of spins? And then as we cool that one down,
there would be a proper phase transition from the unordered Mott insulator to the antiferromagnetic state. And at this phase transition, there is a  spontaneous symmetry breaking and $SU(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, it spontaneously broke. If we are at large $U/t$ we have a critical temperature for when this process happens, which we don't know, we can't really calculate it will see numerically what happens on the next slide. But what we do know is that in this regime for large $U$, you can be neglect doublon-holons, it must scale with the exchange energy so that the \textbf{Ne'el temperature} must change as $t^2/U$. This we know why, because we know the whole energy scale goes like this. We also know that the Heisenberg model will not be valid if you go for weaker and weaker interactions, because at that point doublon-holon pairs becomes important and you would go back to more complicated models.


OK. here is now some quantum Monte Carlo data.
[fig - slide]
\begin{comment}
This is where they just went on brute force and is about 10 years old so people can nowadays do a bit better, but still it's pretty good. And what they say is in  the caller, you do something simulated annealing.
we start off a very high temperature and  artificially cool the system down and see what the energy and the parameters are that you get.
And then they get plots this. what you do, what you do here is there is two parameters and here it is a length.
this is a two by two system, so Ali could six means six by six brackets.
And L equals eight, which they do in some cases. It's eight by eight.
That's the biggest they can do in a not exact but approximate calculation.
What's important for those things is there is a critical position in here,
and if they want to cool down what  package if you want the virtual step size by which they could don't.
It's a parameter that he wanted to take to zero in order to convert to the result.
You can see that in the case of Liquid six, they take three different sizes point one point six point one point zero six point five.
In the case of adequate eight. They only take point one because they couldn't do this more than once because we've been working too heavy.
And then you can see all of these lines, all of these data points, they  like, follow the same trend.
And then they can do something where they say, OK,
we try to extrapolate down to what happens in the infinite system limit and four steps one zero just
by extrapolation and say this is our best prediction of what would happen in the world system.
And then what you can see here is there is the energy. In terms of the tea is a function of temperature.
It is the locks get this lock off the temperature. this is very, very hot and this gets done close to the ground state.
And here is here, you can really see, OK, this is probably the energy of the crowd on stage because here nothing is happening anymore.
And then they would say, Okay, you see two different regimes, you see regime here and the energy increases a little bit.
And then here's a second you wrote increases massively. And what's very intuitive isn't to say, OK, let's look at.
Not the energy, but let's also look at the entropy. What is the entropy on the latter site?
As a function again of this temperature. And you can see here up here, if the tea gets very high, the people at the site shoots up to look for.
And look for makes sense because it is a total capacity of the firm mohabbat model.
But you can only have no political, one more political spin up, spin down or D'Appolonia.
We have proposed configuration for that asite. if you if you reach this look for, you  say, OK, I'm now at the very highly mixed state.
Then you can say, OK, the interaction strengthened their case, this u of a T is eight.
That's what they've chosen.
And then you can look at the end and you can see it when temperature T becomes, that's on the order of between five and 10.
maybe eight. Then the entropy starts to go down.
Because this is now where the system gets colder, where the temperature cap becomes less than you.
you get less and less likely to have this double hold on because they cost no
more energy than you have from an engineer system and you would never expect,
OK? Entropy goes down, the state gets more ordered and then there is no structure in here.
There's something happening in here. What is maybe an interesting point here and the point of inflexion point in the middle?
That's exactly at lock to. This, again, matches what you expect, because this means that in this case, you know,
you have a state where you can really see there's still a lot of entropy, but you see the energy is already pretty low.
But energy wise is already close to the Granite State, but enterprise, it's still pretty high up.
And that again, matches we talked about the low lying spin excitations.
that's in a situation where you have an unaltered, fully developed Mott insulator where the spins are still random.
There's no fluctuated widely. But you already have charge ordering, you already have one particle politicised and no doesn't hold obvious anymore.
And because the energy to care for charge is you, which is very big,
it means you're getting most of the way down and energy, but you're not yet most of the way down.
You only halfway down in entropy because of the spin entropy is there and very low energy degrees of freedom.
that's also what makes quantum mechanism often so challenging and planets matter physics.
But you would say, OK, the charge or they already have a room temperature system is a MI,
a competitor to what's insite that even room temperature.
But to really measure the magnetic fine structure in there, I have to get much, much colder because it lives on this modern energy scale.
OK, so here we hit this OK to. Then the energy and discipline sector goes down forever, and then he had increases and yet rapidly starts to drop.
And that's then something where you get when you are off, then the temperature of a T is point thirty six in this case.
this is where you really start to get to get antiferromagnetic along with or because at that point when you get along with each other,
there's not much freedom left in the system and therefore the entropy then very massively, very quickly drops down.
this is the way how people analyse this, so people will say, okay, well, in this case, when I get to this critical entry,
Peter Beattie also can calculate you can also calculate the spin correlations that you get you see at the same point.
Long way it's been correlations start to appear. That is why the entropy drops so they can say, OK, this is not a critical temperature.
For forming an antiferromagnetic in the system, you see at that point, that's also the point here,
a little lost energy decays off because this system really starts to go into the Quonset.
that's how we know about these numbers coming from quantum with the cost of looking at plots this.
And then this is now a plot done for puberty equals eight. They can  repeat these plots for many, many, many, many different directions.
And then they can get a plot this. what you see here is you have a.
And here you see temperature non-linear set. And what they can say is that, OK, these data points, here they are for the calculations they've done.
We looked at the one you what? You would say it this this data point here where we see there's a critical temperature below eight
point thirty six or somewhere below point for that's exactly this point you then you can see,
OK, where is the interaction? Where is the critical temperature for the antiferromagnetic, for different view of adjacent?
And then they plotted three things here they plot the dotted line.
This line is t squared over you. didn't even go much further than you would.
You would say 10. Because they  know up from down here thinks we just took down one over you.
What was interesting, more interesting is to say, okay, what happens down here on this site?
And he had this idea plot line, but there's no about the quantum of the cargo data.
And that's because in this regime here you have a antiferromagnetic and because you beauty is so small that the particles from a metallic state,
they would not form a and insulated because you are small.
However, you still have this tendency for antiferromagnetic interactions,
and there's a different theory spin spin spin where theory that you can use to calculate that in this state,
you expect a A94 for a magnet with an exponential onset of the critical temperature here.
And that's basically what gives you this dashed line here is the prediction of this  theory and then you see the tier,
the regime in the middle. This is the most complicated one.
That's where the quantum of the cargo data, where you say, Well, OK, you and the exchange energy are all on the same scale.
Everything's coupled together. That makes it very complicated to calculate. And here we can only use the quantum of the cargo data.
And the interesting thing for. For us was a question that was asked for 10 years in the Latino community,
which this paper ultimately answered as we were asking no one if you want to see the country for a minute.
What is the best in two directions? Two things to look at.
You would have thought let's go for very strong use, because then we have a nice fat, modern Sinatra.
And the answer was, well, that's maybe not so good because then the critical temperature here goes on.
The same time you answer was going on here for very weak interactions, but we also not very good,
even though you might be able to put some entropy into the charge sector because the system is very fragile.
And here the answer is not really, as there was around eight nine is the best with you.
And here you can also see plots which we should take from this curve, but to say what is the entropy that we get as a function of temperature?
And then they can match these ones and can say, Well, if you have an entropy of a particle of, say, 0.6 five.
And these are the temperatures that you will get. Point five point three it basically tells you that the critical entropy density you need
to have in order to just get into the antiferromagnetic is a your off point for cable.
less than this look to which is point seven, which you would expect because point seven is the maximum speed entropy.
And you have to go below that point for here is the critical value we would say the antiferromagnetic start.
that's what all of these magic numbers that we sometimes quote say, quantum technologies like, that's how they come about, where they come from.
\end{comment}


OK. Now let's look at some experiments just to see what can be done about all of this. Can this be seen in the lab? And this super exchange process, so the process of particles hopping from one site to the next, also exists with bosons. I should say that people call a superexchange in cold atoms and the CM people say, you're crazy, this is just direct exchange. What we call superexchange is a fourth order process. 
[fig - slide x3. Note also details on spin resolved readout]
\being{comment}
what they did here is they said like, OK, if I have a double world.
Two lattice sites, one left, one right, and I can turn them slightly at slightly different energies, for instance,
then they can have the configuration they have spin up and left spin on the hand site and then by hopping events, J.
This particle can happen to that site or that particular problem to that site.
get back to intermediate states, which are detuned, but it's energy you have a definite left or up to the right.
And they also have flag splitting to Delta, which adjusts the offset between these two sites with respect to each other and then by another hopping.
From there, you can go back to the opposite configuration.
if you do second order perturbation you, you have to calculate now with two different intermediate states.
You get an exchange coupling from here to there. this is what this is, the way to think about it.
And then another important point here was this was done before gas microscopes, but they could be read out of which particles on the left,
which particles underwrite by doing the following trick, they said, Okay, we start with this double well.
It is this, many other words, as the superlatives we discussed a few decades ago.
Then they said, OK, now go to such that I move up this one site first to a very high site and then merge the ones and the particles.
And here we go into the third excited state on the other site.
And then if you do time of flight imaging bent mapping,
you will see the particle stone here showing up in the lowest band because the lowest energy state and the particles up here,
which show up in higher events because they have much more kinetic energy. And then if you combine this one reflects jungle of imaging.
We split the two speed components doing time of flight of a magnetic field.
You can get one picture where in the end you see the spin offs and left and the spin dance on the right.
with this one picture, you can really say, okay, how many particles are left, how many parties on the and which spin state is where?
that's how they can do the measurement. And what he then did is they said, OK, let's start with one configuration.
let's start with the configuration. We always have to spin up on the left and the spin down on the hand site.
And then just jumps to the symmetric W.L., where you have this resonance tunnel happening from the one to the other.
And just look at as a function of time what happens. And this was a science paper line almost 50 years ago.
And you can see three different configurations. The first configuration, eh, up here.
This is a configuration where let the step was not very deep.
So, Jay, over you tunnelling of a hopping was big, so you would expect you're not dead in the mud.
And so that the loss of particles can move around, really. And you can expect that you could see double occupancies and all of those  things.
And if you look at what happened to you in the blue line, which the blue data, which is the spin off data spin for population,
you can see it's a pretty complicated function that doesn't look that intuitive.
But the blue line fits it very well, and the blue line is a fit with two frequencies one frequency of RJ,
the direct path, dark energy of particles hopping left and right. And the second one of order is quit over you.
That's our super exchange process. And, of course, Jay typically is faster than just get over you.
what you don't see, which is interesting, is if you don't make the lattice deeper going to be very deep,
going to see and how you see your this is much slower. You have different, very different times, kids here.
You see, it's already one big sinusoidal wave and the second wave is just a small perturbation around.
And down here, the and you only see the slow oscillation of fossil oscillations totally gone away.
And that's the that's the way you really say this is no super exchange upon a single
particle will never hop on top of the other particle because you is too big.
But the second order exchange process, that slower process is still happening.
you never  see the intermediate state, but you only select the full final results because it's the second order process.
What's the downsite of that? , the dumping mechanism in this case, OK, this is probably not damping in the way,
it's in homogeneously phasing because you have this  alerts,
many of them and you have a big underlying harmonic trap, which means that if the one in the middle is really symmetric,
but the one to the left is to the tilt on it and the one on the is the opposite on it.
all of these little ones we do phase with respect to each other. And that would explain this effect.
Strictly speaking, of course, that's not proven. It's just that it's very likely that it would happen.
people accept that that's the likely explanation. OK.
\end{comment}

And then for the Fermions now, we this was five years ago.
[fig - Greiner slide]
People have seen this antiferromagnet directly with a quantum gas microscope. 
\begin{comment}
what they do is they look at fermions under the microscope so they can really see them individually and each lattice site.
And then if they remove one spin, so they say only look at the spin up atoms, they do see this checkerboard pattern here.
And then reconstruction also shows as nicely. And there's a couple of things that should be said about this.
The first thing to be said about we now have a much better understanding, much,
much better than what we could when we saw this for the first time in the first weak is if you look at the overall potential.
It has a shape this. this is not very, very far from an ironic trip, and this is a very optimised trip.
there's, of course, that this potential on top of that that we can't see because this card is too small.
what you see here is there's a middle region.
Which is the reason we're going to look at the microscope, it's a sampling in the middle of that region is flat bottomed,
so it has the same density everywhere which you need to have, a nice smart insulator so that you can see it for a moment.
And then what you can see here artificially, as you can see these wings, very large wings, very big area.
It's a big ring out here where the density is going to be very, very low.
And the fact that the density here so low is critical,
because that means that at a very low temperature, the particles in the air can carry a lot of entropy.
Intuitively speaking, if the density is very low, each particles have lots of lattice sites to choose from, but wants to sit.
it carries a lot of entropy, even at very low temperatures. And this is entropy management.
This is the idea of saying that. Most of the entropy my nation state will be carried by this low density wings.
And that means that the temperature would be low enough that in the middle, I can focus on different measurement.
And it was a real tour de force to just get to the stage and see that. The problem that you phase is you have to ask, OK, well,
if I want to keep thermal equilibrium between in here and out there, how fast or slow can I do things?
How fast or slow is heat transported in a spin system over this big dislodging area on a charge system?
And as many, many questions, transport questions and all of those  things,
dynamics questions which are much harder to answer than steady questions,
but you  need to have an idea about them in order to be able to look through the static experiment of always,
you never know what's 10x, what's dynamics. this is where really, really are in all of this this.
And the other thing I should say, and we look at this paper in a bit more detail in the next John Clarke, by the way.
then we will see all of the experimental details. The second thing I should say is that this in some sense.
Is a lucky shot, they will not get this quality in every shot. Because remember this spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Sometimes you get lucky, antiferromagnetic, staggered this we did on desert direction, but next to it, it might be this or that, but this.
And if you take many shots, then some of the shots will be very where it's more or less in line with the direction.
And then you will really get something because you measurement phases. Does that phase?
\end{comment}

OK. Just for completeness, here if the FHM phase diagram at half filling. The true phase transitions are shown by the black lines, whereas you can see at higher temperatures you only get a crossover. Note we have not at all discussed what happens on the attractive side, but they are mapped to one another by the Lieb-Mattis transformation.
[fig - phase diagram]
\begin{comment}
And as concentrated on the hand site, there's a temperature.
This is the entire ActionScript. what happens at high temperature is that you have a normal state, which is the metal.
We can really think of this as like, OK, it's just a pharmacy with thermal excitations on top of it.
And then as you increase the interaction strengthen, you becomes at some point you become much bigger than captain if you go in this direction.
Then you have a cross over that line is the shaded area.
Cross over from this metal into a into insulator because you just have less and less and less double occupancy.
So. But there's no symmetry being broken, so there's no hard line, there's no transition.
It's just that this admixture of smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, and at some point here it's not relevant anymore.
And if you go down in temperature,
you reach a phase transition into the chaotic state and the antiferromagnetic state really extends all the way here,
all the exits over here, you get this good of a new regime. It's one of a you dependencia down here.
You have to spin density waves and up here, just quantum of the cargo can tell you what it is.
And this is what you have to be part of, said. Crossover and phase transition.
Now, the other thing to be said is that we have not discussed at all what happens on the attractive site of the system.
And it turns out you can do a funny transformation called the deep mother's transformation, which is  a political transformation,
but only once been component, and that must be attractive to remove parts of system and vice versa.
And therefore, it means that every phase that you have on the hand site must have also a phase on the left hand site.
when you go from the normal state here to the mud and that when you freeze out double occupancies.
You don't have them anymore. What happens here is you get what we call preform pairs because, you know, if attractive into action.
it makes more sense for the particles to be in the same dataset together being bound together.
what you get in this regime here is you get something where the particles are all bound into pairs and give a firm guess of these pairs.
If you now cool down here, this regime.
To think that you only have singlets with at some point start to form an A. for a minute, if you down here this regime, you get the same thing.
Similarly speaking with with the doubloons and the holds because you only have dominance and hose at this point.
And what those will form is the Republican superfluid state. you get a b c of these tightly peers.
And this regime here we have to act is weakly interacting, repulsive, antiferromagnetic for a minute.
What you get in this regime is actually a superfluid.
And then you get a transition in here, cross over from the superfluid into a piece of tightly wound pierce.
But that's a faith tradition in between them. It's just a smooth cross over a ravine. That superfluid phase is just as of the size of your piece.
We come from very big, loosely bound cooper pairs to very tightly bound on types and just a continuous transformation.
In the same way as you would say, here we go from a spin density wave antiferromagnetic to a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic.
And if you would have liked to lecture us more,
we would to have one lecture on this party's transformation and look at this in a bit more detail because it's fun,
but we don't have the time, so we have to move on.

For the last two minutes, let's look at alternatives if we cannot have antiferromagnetic order. And there's a few reasons why you could have this, the first reason this lower dimensions. in 1D, the \textbf{Mermin-Wagner theorem} says that if I have a long range ordered phase in higher dimensions, that's connected to a continuous symmetry, then in one dimension, this would be absent. I will not have long ordered states because quantum fluctuations will destroy the long range order. Now, to remind you about two things, the first thing is that we talk about continuous symmetries. If you look at, for instance, the Ising model, can be the antiferromagnetic you ordered in one because the Ising model only breaks a discrete symmetry, not a continuous symmetry. And the intuitive point is that if I have a single defect in one chain, it  blocks communication between the two halves. But the most interesting partis what happens in higher dimensions. In quantum simulations of the Hubbard model, people have seen that you get into very different phases and also in your height you see materials to culprit. We know that this doping induces this D-wave superconductivity. That's very interesting. And the last part that can, of course, quantify magnetism is frustration. So, for instance, if I have a triangular lattice with the triangle spin up here, spin down there, what shall I put here? 
[fig - frustration]
This frustration also gives rise to more complex states.

What can these states be? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Valence bond solids (VBS states)
\item Spin liquids (for example, resonating valence bond states)
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
How can they look some classic that states definitely discussed for a long time?
The first one is the so-called VBS. states of surveillance upon solid.
The idea here is that you always take a to neighbouring spins and they form a spins of aliens,
want to spin it in these things that are arranged in the periodic fashion that breaks the symmetry of the underlying lattice?
a cartoon of this one would be if I take this triangle lattice here, I can take these two spins,
put them together into a spin singlet to uptown minus turn up in this case, OK, this is the triplet, OK?
And then I do this one and this one at this point.
At this point, at this point, you can see that the bonds themselves, the valence bonds arranged and in a crystalline or.
it's a state it has broken a symmetry, because now the Unitel, if you want, goes from here to here from one start to the next.
it's twice as big as two units that of, you know that.
if a period during which practises create symmetry because it could happen here or it could happen to.
These are maybe less interesting,
the more interesting states are so-called spin liquid states where you have no long range order at all temperatures even in the state.
And one way how you can get them are so-called AVB states resonating valence one states surveillance fund is  this.
Bond between the two parties could see that going to a singlet and resonating means that.
I  a covering of this singlet,
one configuration of how do you think that's arranged over my lattice and I have another can have another one.
And those two can be in resonance, which means they can have the same energy.
And then they're  fluctuating from one to the other, from the one to the other.
The resonating between different configurations and these are babysits is resonating variance upon states.
They have been discussed already by Phil Anderson as a potential explanation for what might be going on insite these materials.
Because the question you can have is if I have this  spin background and have at one site here where I have to, I can have a single,
I see a single spin that's not paired and say, no, I will arrange this bond to this bond, then the unpaid particle sincere.
And then you can calculate the energy for this, and you can ask, can maybe those particles now move through the system in a superfluid way?
And can they don't give rise to superconductivity? And it's one of the stories behind this IPB fury.
There's lots of things in here which are very interesting that we cannot discuss forever because we don't have time.
I hope it's OK for overrun by two minutes today because I still have two slides to show just to show what can be done.

Other additional things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum Ising model 
\item CLassical XY model
\item Spinor gases
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
Also, 50 systems that have a context. you can also take other models of what the mechanism and them of cold atoms.
we now go away from the Fermi about model. That was the Heisenberg model.
One thing that we can do is we can do something Quantum Ising model. the Ising model is that asset is typically a classical model.
And if you want to get a longitudinal field, nothing changes here,
but if you wait also a transverse field so you have an filled next component of the field,
then it turns into a quantum model because you can have fluctuations in that.
You cannot like, say, minimise this to these two terms and that term at the same time.
If you look at the phase diagram of this model, it has antiferromagnetic state,
if these two companies are not important, but if you give it a strong external field over an asset on the X direction,
then you go into a permanent state where everything is then aligned in line with external magnetic field, as you would expect.
And this  model people could to in a staggered so in a tilted pose.
How about model? The idea is the start of an unequal Walmart insulator, one particle, and maybe that's a site.
They noted that there's a lot of they put a big gradient over the lattice.
And if you have this data, you would say in the this microscope, you see one particle in every lattice site.
Now what can happen is that say this particle here? Can they beam hop to the right?
There's a big energy mismatch,
but if they're state of a particle in here and the detuned thing such that e the energy of going left to is the same as you.
the index energy on top of this one is compensating for the step down that this can be a resitent of what can up from here to there recently.
What you also see in this case is that you cannot have the situation and you can map in this.
The political say sitting on the left site is has been up to politics. Having moved to the site is been done.
you can do a mapping from the occupation to a nice spin model and then you can see you get a very interesting spin model because a good spin model,
we can never have two down spins next to each other. You have a constraint in here because if this one particle is spin down,
which means let's move to the left, to the other particle here, so we move to the right.
Sorry, the next part cannot also move to the because there's no you here, no interaction because the particle has left.
what you get that  situation, and if you can get an A. from, I think one state or every other particle has moved over.
we have the dome particle moved over, spin up, particles not moved over and so on.
And you get something if you look to a microscope, you see no particles.
And long story short, it gives rise to this  Hamiltonian exactly the one we had before, and then people could do these things.
Would it change the ratio of you? And it can go from a permanent phase.
We have one party that you say decides to the antiferromagnetic phase where
you have no party gets a single party because you when you have plans on hold on.
And they can go from one to the other and go back. just whistle stop tour.
You can also simulate this  model. You can also go and simulate the classical X Y model,
because you can say the classical X Y model means that I have a classical picture in the plane that points in any direction parameterised.
But if you're an English teacher and that one gets wise to an Hamiltonian this, the Heisenberg model.
But now with this classical vectors? Now, if I think about the BBC's a BEC,
I can describe as locally as a coherent state alpha far and I can say this fitter and fitter can be just the argument the phase of my other.
I can say that and in affirming, I think phase my vote is the same phase everywhere in the antiferromagnetic phase, my BBC would have staggered phases.
And then they can look at these companies.
And they can now use a method where they can change the ratio of some of the things make them positive, negative and the triangle lattice.
And they could see a whole horror of different magnetic states.
They could see ferromagnetic states, state of Rumbek Order or spiral states, and so on.
Basically, what they always do is they always do time of night imaging of the items.
From its regular lattice, and if they see that it's nice hexagonal pattern here,
for instance, they know I have the same phase everywhere, so I'm in ferromagnetic phase.
If I have something this, there's one big phase. We have a line of all spinoffs.
The next line is pencil pointing in the opposite direction.
Then I get in the x direction, still the same pattern that we have before, but in the direction.
It's  the atoms are, know, staggered. it's  a shifted to the edge of the zone and indeed in the direction.
Instead of having one spot in the middle, you see two spots, which can be the edge of the principal.
And that way, you can interpret many things from here to there. And, yeah, classical models can be analysed in this way very often.
And this, by the way, is very interesting because what they cannot do is if you have local control of each of those tunnelling things,
you can say you make this thing positive, this negative, this thing positive listing negative.
People have shown, for instance, that such a bad off in the empty department here is done.
A lot of drug of this to show that this is a very powerful state for doing optimisation problems.
Because you can take many optimisation problem coverings, herdsmen and so on. You can cost them in the language of saying, I put them on the lattice.
my nation state, the positions of all of the things become hopping, which was positive, which was negative and so on.
And then the question of finding the minimum cover this and say, becomes the question of finding a state of the minimum energy.
the state? if you take this big model that you can't really solve numerically because it's very hard.
You can encode that perfectly in lattice and then you take your bosons, just cooled them down gently.
And you just look at the quality that you get. It tells you what you up, what the what the answer to is optimisation problem is.
And this is one very fascinating direction the people are working on,
although we are working on here because what you need for the Senate is local control
and you need to programme this tunnelling that tunnelling this tunnelling and so on, and the technology is becoming available in principle.
But nobody so far has integrated all of this, and we demonstrated that it perfectly works.
it's something that might happen in the next two or three years, so it's very exciting, very exciting development.
And last thing to say is just that, of course, if you forget about let us spinel, guess this is a.
We just have to take all of the spin components in the BBC, all eight hypothyroid states.
And you just asked by imaging, what a  fact the different domains that I get.
And then people can do coarsening that that makes you really look at the expense to actually see what do say.
If I crunched the back very quickly, I get very small domains when you have an A. from a ferromagnetic front, it could very quickly.
If you put it more gently, you can see that, OK, the domains become larger and larger and you get bigger information.
many models can be mapped onto those models, and a lot of work can be done on this.
OK. A bit longer than I should have done, but we got food for it in the end.
Thank you very much. I'll upload the next problem sets today or tomorrow.
And then there's also instructions on when the next join clap, what happened and how I think we're going.
Thanks a lot, Seront.
