Hello and welcome to lecture five of the $q$uantum simulation course. Today's to$p$ic is both on lattices, and then we would talk about how we can introduce the interactions between both zones, which would then be the full Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. And then we will look at the ground state $p$hase diagram of this Hamiltonian. And we see the first transition from a su$p$erfluid into a Mott insulator.

OK, let's get started. We start with a $q$uick reminder of Bloch waves from last weak, basically because our lattice $p$otentials are $p$eriodic. The Bloch theorem a$p$$p$lies and all of the states will be Bloch waves. We'll have energy ga$p$s in the same way as solid-state $p$hysics. And the easiest way to think about these Bloch waves and to think about how we can re$p$resent them is to start by looking at the $p$hotons again, and to say that the new thing in the lattice is that an atom with momentum $$p$$ can absorb a $p$hoton from the left beam, changing momentum by $\hbar k$ basically. Then the overall state is given as a su$p$er$p$osition of $p$lane waves, and the only task that remains, which you are doing in the $p$roblem set, is the calculation of these coefficients in front of this.
[e$q$n]
And this has very im$p$ortant conse$q$uences and the very intuitive way of thinking about the system, because when we do time of flight, when we say, okay, how do we take a measured momentum of a $p$article. We basically do this by this time of flight imaging where we switch off suddenly the lattice, which basically means we $p$roject our Bloch wave, we've ac$q$uired momentum $$q$$ onto the constituent $p$lane waves. And that means we would see for each Bloch wave a set of $p$eaks at discrete $p$oints after time of flight. And then we said, okay, we'll also want to move over to a bunch of functions because we said very often it's inconvenient to have momentum s$p$ace re$p$resentation, because the interactions are local, because the real s$p$ace $p$otentials, tra$p$s and other things that we might want to add, are local. We will want to have a real-s$p$ace re$p$resentation. And here was told in your office last weak that all of you have seen these Wannier functions before.
I should maybe say a few more words about them. The first thing is, again, the reminder that the money functions are defined as a discrete $p$hoto,
some of the ways and we're basically doing this just in a given event.
we say if we take the Bloch away, it's fine. You end invent no end.
Do we get the Bunya function in this band? we don't take all of them, just the ones in one Bloch with one Bloch.
And he's Vanney functions at a localised around two sites that I and I can make one money function on every little site.
But $p$utting in different that ICAO, which didn't show u$p$ as different arguments in this com$p$lex ex$p$onents here.
The bodily functions are. In the $p$ermanent Amik limit to some here turns into an ine$q$ual.
And it was something that was not clear to everyone. the reason for this sim$p$ly is that very often if you do a numerical calculation,
you will only say, I don't want to make calculated infinitely large lattice.
I want to calculate the lattice would say a hundred lattice sites, which is  down in the big box, $p$otentially.
This means it makes sense to only have one hand Bunyah functions.
That asite, one to 100 and that that means if you do the IT before it transform also, you would only have Bloch waves at this $q$uick, crazy moment.
You can think of a $p$article in a box.
The ground state will have a one momentum K and the more at the minus K, you can't fit all u$p$$p$ercase in there because you have this box.
And the same thing, of course we means through if you have a lattice.
If the lattice lives in a finite box, you only have discrete momentum states that are $p$ossible.
these $$q$$s here are discrete and then you have a sum over discrete moment.
And in the firm academic limit. if your box becomes infinitely big.
you go from the box into frees$p$ace. Just kee$p$ lattice $p$otential there.
Then this turns into a continuous distribution. And you go from the sum to an integral.
And the last thing that I was making a $p$oint about, which I think is very im$p$ortant,
is to say that the Wannier functions to Bloch Wavves from an offer moral basis of the food single $p$article Herberts s$p$ace.
That basically means that he can take whatever $p$hysical situation you have. You can describe this all in $p$lain waves.
It's a valid basis, but it's a very inconvenient basis because momentum is not conserved.
You can describe it in Bloch waves, which is maybe for many things better left a better basis because the $q$uantum momentum is conserved.
And the band index very often is conserved because very often you don't have situations. We have Interbrand scattering.
And then if you can like, was $q$uickly served to a single event, you can also very often does $q$uite everything in this.
Baz's of vanua functions just a different basis to Euston. It's also a com$p$lete Baz's because you have these nice $p$ro$p$erties that these
are the most local functions that you can do that would be missing at.
if he'd go away from all of the maybe more abstract definitions you can really think of,
a bit of a Bunya function is to save a half a atom in the lowest band,
and that atom is localised on one that the site I that this is in, this one you from the atom isn't this Wannier function centre.
And this lattice said if the atom was to be formed on that little site, then it would be the vanua function centred around this little site.
And if we wouldn't if it would be in a different band, then it would be the bunya function of two different bent, which would have a different look.
If you think of relatively dee$p$ lattice, you can think of this one as a harmonic tra$p$.
Each lattice site isn't harmonic tra$p$$p$ed.
And then the lowest Wannier function becomes a gorshin and the first Yehya excited vanua functions become the excited states of the harmonic oscillator.
And for those wants that are maybe a bit more mathematical minded, here's another way how you can think about this.
If you say I want to have a local ice $p$article with s$p$ace now outsite of the lattice in frees$p$ace,
you would say the most localised to I can write down is the Delta function,
Delta X minus X, not to lift the $p$article would be localised at the $p$oint X not.
And you know that you can ex$p$ress this as an even su$p$er$p$osition of all of the $p$lane waves each of the X.
Now, the same thing is true, you should look to the Baz's transformation from the $p$lane ways into the Bloch ways,
because we said that the $p$lock ways are often on the basis of all of foubert s$p$ace.
the same way as the $p$lane weighs. I can ex$p$ect the same thing. The data function I can ex$p$ress as a sum of all of the $p$lot ways.
This should be X minus X, not not set changes in Slate and some or all of the bands and.
Because this is to say, S$p$encer had saved them both s$p$ace. Then this one does.
And now if you now say that he was tricked us now to a single band.
there's no sum over all of the bands in here anymore. And just looking at one single and then you can think of this as, say,
I have less momenta at my dis$p$osal because many of the $p$lane waves are known what they are, many of the $p$lot ways.
I'm not there because they live in different bands,
which means that I have less momentum states so they can $p$lay with less basis states of which I can make a localist function.
The function would be less localised.
It we'd be still to be localised around a single lattice site, but it would not be as localised as a delta function.
And the function I get is then the Wannier function. And the last ste$p$ that we did in the last lecture was to say no,
that we have to as Baz's of maximally localist orbital so of the way function that describe a $p$article sitting on one,
let the site in the lowest bend or in bent. And we can then write down the Hamiltonian because such a $p$article.
a dego creates the $p$article Vanya state onsite. And we have Tro$p$$p$ to the end because we're not only thinking about the lowest band.
And then if you went down Hamiltonian, the Hamiltonian fundamentally describes the two terms.
we have to kinetic energy, which is basically saying the $p$articles moving around.
And we say $p$articles move from site J to site eye by being destroyed insite J and B were created insite.
That's just the language to be used here.
The language of this $p$rosodic annihilation creation a$p$$p$aratus and the crickets here, I mean, at the summation is just of our $p$eers,
of nearest neighbours, because we are in a so-called tight,
binding regime of $p$articles can only ho$p$e from one site to its stivic in neighbouring site.
We also said that in a more ingenious system,
the second term is unim$p$ortant because it's  the same energy, irres$p$ective of word of $p$articles are.
And the last term years, just a total $p$article number times the chemical $p$otential.
this is the term that you get Insec in the current canonical ensemble to look at how many $p$articles you would actually ha$p$$p$en to the system.
And we'll talk about more about this term in the next lecture or so.
And then the only thing that we need is the tunnelling term. It's basically saying, OK, how likely is it or how fast is it?
What is the rate for $p$articles going from one site to the next?
And that's basically given a ty$p$ical overla$p$ into $q$uaffed away function on site ie insite a $p$lus one.
And you Hamiltonian in the middle. And this is not a full Hamiltonian to describe single $p$articles in a in the lowest band of an o$p$tical lattice.
It is a slightly heard, Tony, that you would want to look at if you would want to describe, $q$uote,
direct condensation of non interacting $p$articles in a dubious sea of balls Enns in an o$p$tical lattice.
And the next challenge will be to look into it was InterAction's into this Hamiltonian ethem to disarm Etonian.
Becan oscillosco$p$e that we can also see where interacting $p$articles.
And if we add those, then we end u$p$ with the full Boza Hubbard model.
What you can see now here on this $p$lot is the molecular $p$otential between two atoms.
you basically see the $p$otential energy V as a function of the distance between two $p$articles, between the two at between two atoms.
And these molecular $p$otentials, they're obviously $p$retty com$p$licated. And that gives rise to the richness of molecular $p$hysics.
we no need to find a very sim$p$lified descri$p$tion of this that we can use to study anybody $p$hysics.
For this, it's im$p$ortant to think a little bit about these $p$otentials. On the one hand, for long businesses here,
you have a fund of arts interactions into know attractive $p$otential to form one over minus one or two to six out of the six,
because this is an induced ty$p$e, would o$p$en interaction at last distance, large distances, because the atoms are both electrically neutral.
They have no $p$ermanent Di$p$o moment. you don't have any electrostatic interaction, you don't have any di$p$ole di$p$ole interaction.
the next time you get this an induced over do$p$er, one of our art after the six and the $p$otential comes down here, it gets actually very, very dee$p$.
this case, he was one electron. What so does we need, as Khail, of binding energies of wheely bond molecules that you have in we life?
It's not the energies we work at all. Add we've Otakon atoms. these kids is much, much, much bigger than what we are.
The minimum distance of this $p$otential here, what the distance of the minimum is Ti$p$itina out of 10 angstrom.
a few nanometres at most. And then we have a very a fast rising $p$otential on the insite, which is the exchange interaction.
It's more distances. Sim$p$ly said, if the atoms get very, very close to each other, the electron clouds, the electron cloud start to overla$p$.
And then both the $p$oley $p$rinci$p$le and also the culum interaction between the electrons means
that there must be a very strong $p$artici$p$ant to actually 020 Clouds don't wants to overla$p$.
The crucial thing to see here is that this ty$p$ically distances here is ty$p$ical distances.
They are very, very small.
And in fact, the range of this $p$otential sort of range from here to here to $p$otential is really im$p$ortant, is ty$p$ically much, much,
much smaller than both to de$p$loy wavelengths of the $p$articles because the $p$articles are very slow,
because we are very cold tem$p$eratures, which means that de$p$loy where is very hot, very high.
And they're also much, much smaller than the ty$p$ical distance between the $p$articles.
basically, if you want all of our $p$hysics ha$p$$p$ens on, say, this  scale.
But then the interactions case is much, much, much, much shorter.
And that gives rise to a very, very strong sim$p$lification that will make a lot of Yusoff,
which is basically saying that we can be the wheel $p$otential by an effective contact $p$otential.
the $p$articles only interact if they are at the same $p$osition.
our effective $p$otential as a function of AH is just a $p$arameter G times dardar.
$p$articles only interact where they are at the same $p$oint. It's a contact interaction.
It's an a$p$$p$roximation. Do we know the direction is much, much more varied?
Has a medium range travelled from the bottom and so on. But it's a very good a$p$$p$roximation because ty$p$ically we in a situation with a $p$article,
has never ex$p$lored these details of the $p$otential because there are  inherent resolution.
They de$p$loy wavelength and also the distance, the ty$p$ical distance is much, much, much coarse and bigger than the scale of this $p$otential.
And that, of course, makes life much, much easier because he's death $p$otential $p$otentials there much easier to deal with.
U$p$ to 50. This is $p$erimeter as Giese $p$arameterised in the form of four $p$i h $p$ast create over M times of Prometa A where A is the scattering length.
And in the future we mostly talk about different regimes, meaning different scattering things $p$ositive, negative and so on if A is $p$ositive.
We're talking about to be $p$ositive in direction because then the effect of $p$otential is
$p$ositive and yet items have to $p$ay an extra energy when they come very close to each other.
If it's negative, we have an attractive interaction, which ty$p$ically August leads to an instability for BEC., but it would be im$p$ortant for for me.
ty$p$ical $p$arameters. If I take a ty$p$ical BEC. take for instance, Rubidium, 87, one of the easiest atoms to condensate.
I have a scattering length on the order of 100, a not so ty$p$ical wages.
Tenths of a not hundreds of knots is the ty$p$ical range and a knot is half an angstrom, more or less.
It's borrus radius. Have $p$ower, the other thing that's very im$p$ortant and very $p$owerful for cold atoms is that very often we can goondas,
a so-called Feshbach resonances allow us to Judah's about changing the magnetic field.
we just a$p$$p$ly a different magnetic field and we can get a different a.
The effects, stem cell molecular $p$hysics, and I'm not going to go into details here for the sake of time, but you can think of this very often,
that the magnetic field is just a joining u$p$ with which you can join the sign and the strength of the interaction.
you can have not interacting atoms with $p$arts of attractive, strongly interacting,
weakly interacting atoms just by dialling one of the athletic future.
It doesn't work for all that was bedrocks for many cases. And of course, $q$uantum simulation ex$p$eriments, not ty$p$ically a concentration of those atoms.
Like, for instance, $p$otassium atoms where you have nice $p$a$p$er resonances where you can really tune the interaction at will.
OK. how can we not take this and introduce this into our Hamiltonian, which we have written down in second $q$uantise $p$lantation?
If I take the general case off a generic to $p$article interaction term, Whiton in terms of the field o$p$erators,
so the o$p$erators site Dega and BPCI that create and destroy a $p$article $p$osition are $p$rime.
They're basically a generic term they would have to write down is to following interaction.
Energy is given by half the integral of all of s$p$ace for $p$osition $p$article one.
And all of s$p$ace for a $p$osition of $p$article two. And then I have my two $p$articles.
A $p$osition are $p$rime and are and similar to what we did in the descri$p$tion of the tunnelling term.
What we do is we effectively destroy the $p$articles at these two $p$ositions and then we create the $p$articles.
Now in this case at the same $p$ositions. this term if you want.
they go u$p$. they U$p$site's site is  filtering out. You really have two $p$articles at these two $p$ositions.
If yes, then. Okay. And they $p$ut the $p$article s$p$ec there. If not, did the whole term zero.
And it doesn't give us something. And then it basically tells us the $p$otential that you multi$p$ly.
This is the interaction $p$otentially B minus our $p$rime.
if I have two $p$articles at distance are the $p$ositions are and are $p$rime, then their interaction energy is given by the $p$otential V.
At distance R minus one. And this term, of course, can be $p$retty com$p$licated and can be $p$retty unwieldy, too, to use.
But we can sim$p$lify it a lot because we can say, okay. We go to this effective $p$otential.
We say we use as contact $p$otential G times to do function on minus our $p$rime, no F with everything in 3D.
And then, of course, sim$p$lifies things a lot because that basically kurds' one of those anti$q$uity integral over our $p$rime.
And we're basically left with G halftimes integral over R.
Dega u$p$site. Dega u$p$site u$p$site. it basically says only when two $p$articles are at the same $p$osition are then they would have an interaction
and mgg doing Hardisty because they have to o$p$erate this year and definitely have  two $p$ossibilities.
How I can have these two $p$articles. it cancels out of I have this interesting stu$p$idity argument.
OK. And now we want to, like, describe this  generic interaction term in our bases of any functions that we have justified.
let's do this and let's take the city emulation of annihilation o$p$erative sigh and write this one in terms of Ste$p$hania basis.
basically saying destroying a $p$articular $p$osition ah is the same as destroying a $p$article is a $p$osition of all of those Wanya functions.
A.I.M. weighted by the Bunya function at this $p$otential.
we're basically saying, Hugh, I think of a $p$arty, it is $q$uite a $p$arty, but it's  a data function of all.
And as I said before, the Vimy functions are full, com$p$lete, often on the basis who I can ex$p$ress everything.
Also, the data function as is what $p$osition of all of those functions. we can do this and we get a term that's $q$uite a bit more unwieldy again,
because now we have to say we still have our integral and we have to ade$q$uate of U$p$sidaisy U$p$sidaisy U$p$site's CI a.
Each of those terms. they go. And so we've ex$p$ressed as a sum of all of those Vanney function.
we have no  fourfold some over four eyes and four ends.
We have our creation annihilation a$p$$p$aratus here and we have to vanua the $p$rotocol for Bunyah functions.
And this term is, of course, $p$retty unwieldy, and the main $p$oint to see from this term is that because you have different ends in here,
because you have a different you have one inde$p$endent and inde$p$endent I for each of the four o$p$erators that you have to $p$ut in.
It tells us that the directions can, in $p$rinci$p$le, cou$p$le of different bands and let the science.
Which in $p$rinci$p$le makes sense, what if I have only a function on one,
let the site and the manufacturer in the second bend and the same, the other site is VantagePoint is o$p$en u$p$.
They live on the same s$p$ace. in $p$rinci$p$le, I can due to the interactions,
have $p$articles going from the one bad into the other bent getting destroyed and the one bunyah function and being
recreated in the other one you function are of those terms are more $p$ossible in this  interaction term.
I can also say that in $p$rinci$p$le I can have an interaction between atoms on neighbouring Letha site, because if you look at the vanua functions,
the blood of them, they always have the small extra site lobes, the small rabidity of the $p$article also being on the next Letha site.
here's the unwieldy term again. And now we sim$p$lify it again because we say we take a$p$$p$roximation if we retain the biggest term
only and the biggest term is the one where all of the eyes are the same and the ends are the same.
And in addition, we assume that only $p$articles are the $p$articles are all in the lowest band, that only the lowest band is occu$p$ied.
And then we can basically say, okay, well, instead of having all of those songs over for Ice and four forehands, we only have one sum over I.
And we only get I Dega, a dagger eight toy, a Heidegger, Heidegger,
a I and then the integral over the vanua function in the lowest banded indicator, but is zero onsite.
I took the $p$ower for absolute Wannier of the Wannier of the Wannier function to the fourth $p$ower of the Wannier.
Because Johann fixator com$p$lex conjugate times do not com$p$lex conjugate, which basically gives me u$p$set.
They just $q$uit and they have to su$p$$p$ort a two time. I get the absolute Wannier integrated to the fourth $p$ower.
And this is no neat, because if we know half the $p$oints that all of the vanua functions around all of Letha sites ie are the same,
it sim$p$lifies even further because we can basically and say which read the site to look at.
Doesn't matter. And you can define a new constant which will call you, which is just g. times to anti$q$uity.
Are over the bunya function of a one budney function to the fourth $p$oor.
And then the last thing that we want to deal with this, this O$p$erators' Euro$p$e is a dagger, a dagger AA.
And for this, we just have to remember that a and a dagger ome$p$razole nick o$p$erators.
we after was only commutation relation. The commutator a dagger e$q$uals one, which is if you work it out as a dagger minus a dagger, a e$q$uals one.
you can say that a dagger a you can write as a dagger minus one.
If you take this, you can go to this $p$roduct that we had here, a dagger, a dagger, A.
That's the $p$roduct we have u$p$ here. We can take it.
We want to like, change the order of this middle $p$air here, a dagger able to change this into a a dagger.
Then we know from the line that both to begin to minus one. in total, we have this extra term, a dagger, a it's just a dagger.
And this A and the minus one here in the middle as the second term.
And this is convenient because a dog or a is nothing else.
And the number of Reutter N. a dog or a dog or a the first one here.
This just ends $q$ueered so it can basically white this now as ends $q$ueered minus end or end times and minus one.
Which means in total, if I take this interaction, energy and did is not the final result,
if we need the interaction energy for bosun's and an o$p$tical lattice is given by you over to you is a constant,
which is basically given by this thing. It de$p$ends on your vanua function to tided of any function is confined.
The bigger the vanua function in the Middle East and the bigger the $p$ower of the money function is that a bigger integral becomes.
And on G-suit, therefore on the interaction constant a on discovering links to a source, just a $p$arameter you is just a $p$arameter for us.
You over to time, sum over I and I and I minus one.
And this is now a very sim$p$le result. It makes sense to think about it a little bit.
And I is the number of atoms on that asite, I and what it basically tells us that each of the atoms on Letha site,
I will interact with the N minus one other atoms and at the site.
if you want, you have N times and minus one and two action terms in here.
Now, because the $p$articles are indistinguishable. The interaction of $p$articles, one with three and three or if one is the same thing.
we basically did some double counting in here and all combinations ha$p$$p$en to all combinations are showing u$p$ twice in the sun,
which basically means we have one half year in front to com$p$ensate for that.
if we have one $p$article on here, we got a one time zero low interaction as it should.
If we have two $p$articles, we have two times one. we get two in here divided by these two cases.
One. we haven't two action. And you so used into action, energy of two $p$articles on the left site.
And then you can calculate what ha$p$$p$ens for three $p$articles, four $p$articulates and so on.
And just for those of you who worked on the Atomic, an o$p$tical $p$hysics course,
you basically have seen something with interaction, energy and minefield just goes and s$q$uared.
you made what might want to know, how does this $p$lay out with this end times and minus one we have here?
And the answer is very sim$p$le. If you have many, many $p$articles in the same mode, dear, you were talking about it.
You see with thousands or hundreds, thousands of $p$articles to have this much bigger than one.
You basically get that End-Time and minus one is basically the same as N and you find that the interaction energy just goes and s$q$uared.
for large m the ends $q$uia term that you half of the cost DSG e$q$uation is correct.
But if you really, really go down to very small numbers and remember it's an o$p$erator.
it is really the $p$rojection of the $p$article numbers that you get.
Then the $q$uantised nature of the $p$article number is im$p$ortant.
If I say I have a half a $p$article and let's decide on one $p$article and let the site then ends, create would be one.
But if I have one $p$article, there's nothing for it to interact with. we need to have something where four e$q$uals one, the total to X energy zero.
And that's is just given by this end times and minus one.
The next ste$p$ now for us is to sim$p$ly combine all of those resources that we have and fully write down the four Boza Harbour to Latonia.
here we have it. The first term is to kinetic energy that it actually arrived last lecture and looked at earlier this lecture.
The second term is the interaction, energy that we have just arrived.
The third term is the local $p$otential energy, which is relevant only if and only if the onset energy de$p$ends on eye.
So, for instance, if you have a tra$p$ or have a su$p$er that this would be high, low, high, low, high, low.
But we can very often neglected. And the last term is new times and chemica $p$otential times total at a number which is only relevant in a crank.
Michael Ensemble and I talk about this again a bit later. When is this the valid Hamiltonian to describe our system?
Whereas a cou$p$le of things that we need, but they're actually very moderate and they're easy to achieve.
The first one is we need a reasonably dee$p$ lattice.
we need to be in this tight binding limit, which basically just means that lattice ste$p$ needs to be at least five we call,
which is easy to achieve and we just do regime $p$eo$p$le normally broken. The second one is we need to have not too strong interactions because remember,
we made this a$p$$p$roximation that we took out all of those terms with cou$p$le different $p$aths.
We were basically saying we just looking at the biggest terms and the one is just a good a$p$$p$roximation.
If the scattering length A is much smaller than let us constant.
That is constant, ty$p$ically is a cou$p$le of hundred nanometres. If I think about rubidium, what it's getting left is Neudorf 10 nanometres.
That's a very good a$p$$p$roximation or e$q$uivalently, e$q$uivalently, I can also say that my,
you know, interaction, energy, you hear, should be much, much smaller than the bandcam$p$.
And ty$p$ically, if I'm say about five, we call it six, we call. That's also very well fulfilled.
this is defined. basically what this means is that both re$q$uirements are ty$p$ically fulfilled with vertical atoms and
o$p$tical lattices a day for wheely faithful or accurate im$p$lementations of the Boza HUBBARTH model.
And later on, the Fermi, but not limited affirmance.
And it's a very neat situations, a very different situation from Sonnet's, because in solids, these are only ideally highly idealised models.
And therefore, it was very hard to ask, OK,
if the $p$redictions of these models to not describe the $p$hysics moves here to be a solid isn't just a wrong model,
or if we just solved the model in the wrong way here because we really faithfully im$p$lement that model, we can answer that $q$uestion.
now let's look at the crown states of this model. Let's ask you to take off.
This was a Hubbard model and neglect the last term here.
I forget about that one that I would say that I have a fixed feeling. I also don't have to worry about this term.
What would be the $q$ueen status of this model? And very often $q$uantum mechanics, you know, have two o$p$$p$osite terms.
You have the kinetic energy term ante interaction. And it's a term and you can ask yourself which term will dominate?
And well, if you go into different regimes, you will get different answers.
If you first start in the case where you are zero. an interaction energy is zero and T is $p$ositive.
this is not interacting limit. And there we already know what the $q$uantitate will be to cross.
It would be a su$p$erfluid. It would be it was Einstein condensate. In this case, we only have kinetic energy.
if we have an abels ons, they will all go into the kuiken.
Zero Bloch wave. The lowest Bloch wave. we basically half the ex$p$ression for the lowest Bloch wave to the end of an eighth $p$ower.
we $p$ut all atoms into the single $p$article Chron state. And the second $q$uantise notation, the $p$roc wave of go zero,
whereas the $p$hase factors vectors can be just within as a discrete sum of all of the Bunya states.
This is if you want a discrete Fuyu transform from the Bunya states back into the waves.
we are now ex$p$ressing the Bloch wave as the sum of all of the various states.
And we o$p$erate with this one to be an eighth $p$ower onto the vacuum state,
which basically means we take a $p$articles and $p$ut each $p$article into the single $p$article $q$uantity.
that state is then a delocalised state where every $p$articles  delocalised over the whole lattice.
And if you look at that state in various descri$p$tions, you will find that the state is a su$p$er forward state.
It has long range Aurora off there and along which order because it is A, B, C state and its $p$hase coherent,
which basically means that you think of the $p$hase and on which $p$hase order an image measured a fluke of $p$hase of the way function to one.
And I can $p$redict where it's it's everywhere else.
now we take all of those conce$p$ts from the $p$hase transitions lecture long which order $p$hase coherence off date and language.
And they all a$p$$p$ly to this. Beezy. If we know two ex$p$eriments, if we measure this B.S. in lattice, what do we get?
Well, if we measure in momentum s$p$ace, we get a momentum distribution. It looks this.
We have the ty$p$ical B.S. $p$eak of zero momentum and we have the satellite $p$eaks that we discussed in the last lecture,
$p$lus two and minus two, $\hbar k$ in both the X as well in the Y direction and some higher order terms.
And that's a conse$q$uence because we now don't have condensation in $p$lane waste, but condensation of longways.
If we were to look and we can do this with a microsco$p$e, $q$uantum gas microsco$p$e locally and ask how many atoms to essy on each lattice site,
you will get something that will look very it is ordered because each $p$article, each atoms delocalised over the whole lattice.
Then they will do a measurement and a $p$rojector $p$article numbers down to a $p$rojector $p$article
down to individual lattice size because they measure how many $p$articles I find here.
Each $p$article, which will be $p$rojected down into one, let the site arbitrarily.
And that means that it will have various different atom number two that can measure in different lattice sites just by Chi$p$ by chance.
Some will seem em$p$ty. Some moves him with one. Ednas two. It is three atoms we will see in a few slides.
It actually will follow a $p$ersona in distribution.
If I take the u$p$$p$er limit, if I take the limit of infinitely stronger $p$arts of a direction, which basically means I take, you know, to be $p$ositive.
if a $p$ositive, re$p$ulsive energy and I take the kinetic energy to be zero teakwood zero, which means a very, very dee$p$ lattice.
Then we will be in a state and we'll call a modern insulating state. now if if you want to, like, minimise your Connecticut, your energy.
Only energy, you have to minimise the interaction and energy, which basically means you just have to go out of each other's way.
You should never $p$ut more than one $p$article on the lattice site. if I have in total as many $p$articles as I have lattice sites.
I am filling one, then basically what I get is a state where I $p$ut exactly one $p$article into each lattice site and that's it.
the White House down. I take one $p$article, a dagger, and $p$ut it on and $p$ut one $p$article on site.
I o$p$erating with a dagger, o$p$erating in a vacuum, as usual, filling in.
And in this case, it's the filling factor.
If we have any good one you can forget about, it just means that you $p$ut a one $p$article in each lattice signed in Protocol four.
I means that you $p$ut Notah $p$articles one insite one one. And so two, one and two and three wanted to add four and so on.
The state that you now get if you look at that state in weird s$p$ace,
you would find exactly one $p$article and each lattice sent because that's what you did by Hot almost behind you.
Put them one in each lattice. And that's the state.
If you have this comment about filling us with $q$ualities, you have as many $p$articles as you have lattice sites.
That's the $q$uantity that you will get. If you look at that state in momentum s$p$ace, the calculator's next lecture.
But intuitively s$p$eaking, because each $p$article is more localised to an individual, that site very localist need s$p$ace.
It must be very delocalised the momentum s$p$ace because each $p$article now wheely
sits in one of those VNU orbitals and the $p$osition of all of the Bloch waves.
That basically means that all of the Bloch waves are e$q$ually occu$p$ied.
And you get a very $p$rivate element and distribution, as I said, with calculators in detail in the next lecture.
the state we get now is and insulating standards an insulator because the $p$articles are localised.
There's no conductance they cannot conduct. For instance, a $p$article currently cannot conduct energy.
The state is also incom$p$ressible. The su$p$erfoods state is very com$p$ressible because you can always $p$ut more items in.
This date is very incom$p$ressible. It's a ca$p$$p$ed state because if you no want to $p$ut another $p$article in here in this state,
it this $p$article will necessarily have to sit on to$p$ of an already existing $p$article.
that will have to $p$ay this extra interaction energy you. And that means it's very ex$p$ensive to $p$ut another $p$article.
India doesn't excitation ga$p$. We'll see it in a minute.
And the state is different and com$p$ressible. And because all $p$articles are now localised, we need each $p$article is localised to its own set site.
And there's no long Wenche $p$hase coherence.
they matter where field and left hand site now has nothing to do with tomatoey fields on the hand site.
the $p$icture for this state is viewed at each ethem as localised to a single site.
And this date can only exist for commentor at filling.
Which means if the number of atoms divided by the number of lattice sites is an integer one at de$p$oliticise two Etna's $p$oliticised three,
four, five and so on. If you have, say, one $p$oint two atoms $p$oliticised,
then you will always have a few excess $p$articles on to$p$ of this modern sitting background
and they are free to move around because they $p$ay the same into action energy everywhere.
And then the whole state will turn into a su$p$erfluid. What I should at this $p$oint $p$oint out that so far we've only discussed we didn't limits.
We've only discussed limit were either we have known and interacting $p$articles into which
energy zero or we are strictly localised $p$articles where the kinetic energy is you.
And it worked. We will see in the next few slides a next lecture that actually these two states I.D. two $p$hases,
mountains $p$hase and su$p$erfluid $p$hase Dennet only belet in these two limits.
They really connect all the way u$p$ to some $p$oint in the middle where we have a $q$uantum $p$hase transition from a su$p$erfluid into a modern insulator.
Well, I should also say there's a warning that the descri$p$tions, e$q$uations, if you will, Don,
here saying, OK, this is the su$p$erfluid state and this is the modern silhouetting state.
These e$q$uations, these weigh functions, they are only embedded in these limits.
if I take a mild insulator and I $p$ut in some kinetic energy, the state fundamentally will we mean a mild insulator.
But the way function would be far more com$p$licated than the sim$p$le way functionally will down here.
it is way function is only develo$p$ed in the limit, and this way function is only valid in the non interacting limit.
And this date does not insulate the transition in the Boso Hubbard model was for
the first time observed in an ex$p$eriment close to 20 years ago by Marcus Kayna.
Tim and Esslinger Eumundi the $p$lot to tensioned others.
And that was really the starting $p$oint for this whole business of $q$uantum simulators.
And this $p$a$p$er read did had the first observation of this is also the first $p$a$p$er that we look at in DeJohn Club on Foresty.
let's start to describe these states a bit more, $q$uote, $q$uantitatively and try to understand them a little bit more.
And let's start with this smart insulator in this $p$eculiar limit will be a $p$ositive interaction, energy.
But the kinetic energy is zero. That limit is ty$p$ically called the atomic limit to its limit.
Rattier zero. You as $p$ositive. you have a T. If you want this limit of you, what you going to infinity?
Because in this case, the full Hamiltonian that we have is just interaction, energy you over to some over I and items times and I'm minus one,
the interaction, energy and the chemical $p$otential to our minus mbewe times.
And so now we should think a little bit more about what this term actually means.
And what is this new draught? Like I mentioned a cou$p$le of times, you in this case is the chemical $p$otential.
we're thinking in the crank canonical ensemble and we're saying that new is the derivative of total energy.
With res$p$ect to $p$article number, we are Teagle zero, which makes life easy.
Otherwise you would have to say that this is under the condition of constant entro$p$y.
you would have seen this term in the Firmament Statistical Physics lecture last year.
And as a reminder, it's  telling you how much energy will the state gain if you add another $p$article?
the way you can think about this is you can think about this if you have a cou$p$le of subsystems.
And then there is like, say, more $p$articles that you want to $p$ut into the subsystem.
You can ask each subsystem how much energy you would you need to take u$p$ in order to take u$p$ this extra $p$article.
And then the $p$article will go wherever it's the chea$p$est for it to go to, wherever the chemical $p$otential of that subsystem is the lowest.
A slightly sim$p$lifies flies, a slightly sim$p$lified but rather good analogy is to say if I have a better
we have a certain voltage here and I $p$ut two leads into my system,
will the better we try electrons into the system or not? Well, if the voltage to chemical $p$otential of the battery is higher than that of the system,
it will drive more $p$articles in there until the chemical $p$otential of my system is as big as the one off my bedroom.
this will be im$p$ortant later on when you want to this good $p$arty, good say over a tri$p$ or it can be very convenient to we now,
it's just a convenient $p$arameter for us to see how the item number behaves in certain limits.
let's make a little truth table for this direction and ask what is the
intersection energy that we have for different $p$article numbers to table this year?
And you can always calculate it yourself.
If an eye is zero, zero times minus one, goes zeros into an energy zero, as you would ex$p$ect, no $p$articles, no interaction, energy.
If you have one $p$article, one minus zero gives zero to no interaction, energy for a single $p$article.
If you have two $p$articles. Two minus two, minus one gets once we have two times one, you have to divide it by this one half year,
you get in total factor of two and then year to S.A.G. increases forever.
They have three $p$articles. I have three $p$oint three times two.
in total, six divided by two gives me three. And it also is intuitive because I have three $p$articles.
One, two, three. I have three $p$airs of $p$articles that can interact.
I have three $p$airwise interactions. I $p$aid three times the energy.
And then if you're four $p$articles, four times three, it's twelve. Divided by two gives me six.
you can see how it into each energy increases.
What you can also see is that each ste$p$ u$p$ from here to here is one from here to here as to from here to here is three.
two ste$p$s always get one bigger. now $p$lot the ex$p$ected average density for this Hamiltonian.
It only has the interaction energy in it as a function of the chemical $p$otential.
you ask which $p$article? No n will minimise the total energy, including the chemical $p$otential term.
And here's New York. This is PRODAN units of new over you. a chemical $p$otentially in units of you.
Then you would see that for a negative chemical $p$otential, the minimum is always at zero.
Because of every negative chemical $p$otential, this term here is $p$ositive.
we just have to total and a total the total minimum of this term in order to get the minimum term.
If I have if I'm between zero and one so small and $p$ositive, I have a small negative term here.
if I end is bigger than zero, if I $p$ut a $p$article in there, this term becomes negative.
If this term, Mr. Zero, the whole thing wins. The minimum was there.
And I have one $p$article on each lattice signed and then its chemical $p$otential going through you.
There's exactly at this ste$p$ here I go from one to two and it's now chea$p$er, better for me to have two $p$articles in the game in the system,
because then New Times two is bigger than the interaction term here and the total thing has its minimum to.
you can see that the average $p$article number will increase from zero to one.
It's chemical $p$otential. Zero. We've stayed in that one until I reach chemical $p$otential of one you.
And then it would jum$p$ u$p$ to energy to density to. And then it's you.
Because two to three and so on. if you think again about this $p$oint of how easily you can $p$ut in more $p$articles.
Well, if my chemical $p$otential is negative, I don't want to $p$ut $p$articles anywhere. If my chemical $p$otential becomes $p$ositive.
the better, he says, I want to $p$ut $p$articles in the system. The system eagerly absorbs the first $p$article.
That's fine because the first $p$article doesn't cost any energy,
but it will not acce$p$t the second $p$article because then you would have to $p$ay into action and you so
only have the chemical $p$otential to change in total energy $p$er $p$article number is bigger than you.
Then it makes sense to absorb the second $p$article Padian to each energy you and go to an e$q$ual to.
And then only if chemical $p$otential goes to two. I can't ste$p$ off to you going u$p$ from you to three, you and I increase my density again by one.
here's basically the same thing that I have said just now written down.
this $p$lot of density is a function of chemical $p$otential. Now consists of shar$p$ ste$p$s.
Because where he was zero chu$p$ ste$p$s, that final tem$p$erature will be moved off and incom$p$ressible Patos in between.
incom$p$ressible, I mean, 20 com$p$ris ability is the derivative any new.
the change in density is a function of changing chemical $p$otential.
And if I have a flat line here, that means my density does not change when I change my chemical $p$otential.
That remains constant. That's the insulating incom$p$ressible A that you would ex$p$ect.
if you're in a state with any e$q$ual one where the average ETA member is one and you have this ty$p$e of Hamiltonian u$p$ here,
then you're in this modern sedating state. if you ask what's the $p$robability of finding one $p$article on the Letha site?
That's exactly one. That's a trivial $p$lot on this slide, but this year to contrast with the $p$lot on the su$p$erfluid slide in a few minutes.
Another thing we can ask about this modern intellectual new atomic limit is we can ask about the excitations s$p$ectrum.
Will it have? Will it be Ke$p$ler's? it can have very chea$p$ excitations? Or will it be ca$p$$p$ed?
Do we have to $p$ay a certain amount of energy to create an excitation? If you think about the state, think of any good one.
You have exactly one atom at the site sitting here and now you want to do anything of that.
Say you want to change the state in any way.
Then you realise that the lowest energy version you can do as you take one $p$article at moving and all of its neighbour.
That's the smallest excitation you can do. And this excitation will cost the energy you, because now you suddenly have one that really occu$p$ied.
Let the sites see one thing in the air where you have two items on it at the site doubly occu$p$ied.
you $p$ay next iteration and G.U.
what we say is that there's excitation creates one double occu$p$ancy, the double occu$p$ied let the site and a hole.
an em$p$ty Letha site. And $p$eo$p$le also sometimes call us a Do$p$$p$ler on hold on $p$ower.
Du$p$lantis, O.W. Occu$p$y that the site and the whole honesty em$p$ty at the site.
And because they are  close to each other, it's a $p$air of that. the excitation s$p$ectrum is ga$p$$p$ed.
The lowest excitation you can do is costing energy. You.
How do we describe these dates? How can we describe these dates and second $q$uantise notation, that's actually rather sim$p$le.
We take the states and each lattice site and we can describe them as FOK states.
That's number states. we say to state, well, we have an Athans on a lattice site.
I'm just talking about the single lattice site again. I can write the Fox State N as the state where I with to vacuum.
And then just $p$ut n $p$articles into the state. I o$p$erate with the creation of Paretta, a dagger to the $p$ower of N.
And then I have this $q$uote. And factorial here to kee$p$ the $p$henomenalist.
And again, I do this mostly in order to have the com$p$arison to the state we get for the su$p$erfluid state in the fusillades.
if I go on, I have my Fox date, the Fox dates are the existence of no o$p$erator.
Fox did end u$p$ number o$p$erating and o$p$erating on that. Just give it a number.
And that's what we im$p$licitly used all the time. When you when we look at calculating the two energies.
And if I extra ventilation o$p$erator a on the state and then I get the state and minus one, which is clear, we have an in front.
You've seen this already and one B $q$uantum mechanics. If I ask about dustu$p$s, Foxtail carry any $p$hase information, so does this Fox.
Is this Fox then able to interfere of anything? And the answer is no.
The Fox states cannot interfere of anything because they carry no $p$hase information whatsoever.
basically the ex$p$ectation Wannier of PSI in such a fox did say as the field o$p$erator is zero.
Even though the ex$p$ectation Wannier of size $q$ueered in the fox, it is non-zero.
For those of you that no $p$hase to $p$hase based re$p$resentations, s$p$eaking of functions and so on,
the Fox state is a state that's  a little ring around zero, so it has no $p$referred direction.
the ex$p$ectation that you outsite this direction and this direction and this direction is zero.
But the ex$p$ectation Wannier of Time S$q$uare, the distance from the origin that is non-zero because you're in the swing with a certain radius.
If not, that's not clear to you yet. Then don't very that will become more clear when you look at when we look at the next state on the next slide.
And now the mod insulator India atomic limit.
And again, I'm stressing in the atomic limit out of this, it will be more com$p$licated, is just described by a $p$roduct of local Foxton.
it I say $p$roduct of all at the sites I be $p$ut and atoms on each set asite.
OK. After now having discussed, some $p$ro$p$erties of this strongly interacting limit Gatemouth,
limit the Fox dates and to insulate us, dear, we noticed cause a little more than not indirectly limit.
Look at the few $p$ro$p$erties of this one. Certainly not a can case.
The way function is already set is that each atom is in the same state.
If a macrosco$p$ic occu$p$ation of a single $p$article can state of the Bloch.
And if you now ask again about the local distribution of $p$article numbers,
you realise that each of the end $p$articles has an e$q$ual chance to be found in any of the
lattice sites because the Bloch waves are se$p$arate out evenly over the whole system.
basically the chance of each $p$article to be found in each and every lattice site is the same.
Which then means that local ETA number follows a multinomial distribution. This is basically a generalisation of the binomial distribution.
if you would have an $p$article's, you would se$p$arate them out of a two lattice sites.
Then you would have a binomial distribution.
And that would $p$redict you how likely it would give you the $p$rediction of how likely it would be to find how many atoms on each of the lattice sites.
If you not have to, but many of them, it's sort of a binomial you can imagine normal distribution.
This one looks, of course, a bit more com$p$licated.
But the same thing, the same thing a$p$$p$lies to the binomial distribution that you have seen in the ex$p$erimental methods course already in one bean.
That's the $p$oint that this can be sim$p$lified to a $p$roduct of $p$recise distributions on each lattice site.
Suki s$p$eaking. That's true in a Crenn canonical Osogbo, where a total at a number does not need to be conserved.
But it's not so matter. It's not so im$p$ortant at this stage.
What's im$p$ortant is that we really ex$p$ect a distribution that looks this.
Now it's a $p$ersona in distribution on each lattice site.
if you have an average at a number of one, it, you know, su$p$erfluid state, you have a high $p$robability of finding one atom.
But you have e$q$ually high $p$robability of finding zero atoms on another site.
And that's com$p$ensated for by a smaller $p$robability of finding two, three, four or even more atoms on this Letha site.
we get this local atom number fluctuations, everybody I've seen on the introduction slide.
The next thing is that it's obvious that not working case, the system must have ke$p$t this ex$p$ectation.
it cannot be ke$p$t. But it must be ke$p$t less, because the reason is that each $p$article, it sits in a single $p$article crown state.
But the single $p$article, Crozet, has a continuous dis$p$ersion relation. E$p$son of Q this minus Corzo dis$p$ersion.
We have 90 lattice. basically it can take any of the $p$articles indices and create an excitation.
We're just creating an excitation weaksite. This $p$article was modified to a small fine momentum because it is $p$ersonal relation.
It continues disfigures Ke$p$ler's. And for the ex$p$erts that have done the AOP, the AQ GOP lecture Rozario on last term.
If I take weakend directions, the form of this dis$p$ersed relation changes.
It goes into the bubble. You are forming its thoughts of linear. But the excitations nonetheless remain gutless.
These excitations, I can then think of collective exhortations density waves of Honan's, but still they are gutless.
Okay. The other thing how I can describe his $p$ersona distribution's how I can describe this would you know me?
The distribution is to realise that the Muji normal distribution will affect the rise into local coherence states Cohu in states UFS Unity,
A.P. lecture. And they're basically given by a su$p$er $p$osition of the Fox states and.
Mandela characterised by an com$p$lex number Orfa, so the cohu coherent state with coming summer offers given by each of the miners.
I offer absolute various $q$uite a to as a $p$refecture. And then the sum of all fox dates.
And you could see to infinity of IFR to the end. Normalised in this way.
Times the Fox state and. it is Cohu and states have been introduced as the Igen states of DNA relation o$p$erator,
which basically means if I take your nation on the state of war, I just get four times over.
they just like. Re$p$roduce themselves under the annihilation o$p$erator.
And these dates are very crucial in $p$ersons' $q$uantum o$p$tics because they are the state's.
Were large am$p$litude over that corres$p$ond to Cohu and classical Lightfields am$p$litude,
often absent Wannier Phifer and the $p$hase $p$hy, which is the argument of over.
this com$p$lex number of unknowingly really encode something that classically
corres$p$onds to the MP Tudeh of a classical field and the $p$hase of a classical field.
they are the crucial states that make the connexions between $q$uantised Lightfields, for instance, and classical electrical fuse.
We would say have a well-defined $p$hase and they are also crucial for us.
If you think of metal with o$p$tics, if you think of the $p$ieces because they are Notah states that locally have a $p$hase.
If you calculate their number distribution, that's something that's easy to calculate.
You ask, what's the $p$robability of finding any $p$articles in such a coherent state?
And these are all calculations that you've done last year.
You'll realise it's the overla$p$ into e$q$ual between the e$q$uivalent state over and the Fox state, an absolute make a.
And you basically get the debt. Turns out to be a $p$ersona distribution where the average $p$article number really
ex$p$ected $p$article number for a state al$p$ha is just given by absolute Wannier.
Foskett am$p$litude does the intensity if you want.
Im$p$ortant $p$oint for us now is that you can now calculate the ex$p$ectation Wannier in the clearance date of the insulation o$p$erator,
BPCI, the field o$p$erator. That one is non-zero. As we said already, u$p$ here in the discrete version, it's not zero.
And that means at launch $p$ure B.S. at Duigan zero,
which can be described as a $p$roduct of this local human states with a constant $p$hase to $p$hase is the same
everywhere because of long range order really shows u$p$ that these u$p$ these correlate u$p$site deg u$p$site J.
In this s$p$ecies, date is not zero and it becomes inde$p$endent of IFJ because the $p$hases are not a $p$osition, it's not $p$osition de$p$endent.
we really have off there along language order. what this means is that, as I said before, the su$p$erfluid state is a ordered state.
It's a state with a$p$$p$roximately this $p$hasey $q$ueer freedoms $p$roblem.
We have one s$p$ontaneously chosen $p$hase that we will see and hear.
now we can have a better understanding of the two limits, the non into acting limit and the atomic limit, and we can now ask.
Can you also say something about the about the whole $p$hase diagram in between?
And the answer is yes, we can, because we can start by saying that the su$p$erfluid has a broken symmetry.
We just discussed it. It has this order, $p$ragmatism of their language or outlaw.
Wait a month. And today that does not have a broken symmetry,
which means that these two limits have been this must be se$p$arated by a $q$uantum a $p$hase $p$osition at some critical $p$oint.
You a C critical eulogy. It cannot be a cross over.
Because we go from a $p$hase that has no $p$roblem symmetry into something, it has broken symmetry.
there must be a $p$hase transition in between. And Jay, here is what was t a few slides ago.
As I said before, T and J are we can the same thing for us. We will use them in the same manner and go back and forth between them.
let's make a few $p$lots. Let's make us catch the first catch I want to make is the X axis is always U of a J.
it's the way to between interaction, energy, you add to kinetic energy J.
Or what was t a few slides ago. And we know that we have these two limits.
You were J being very large. That's the atomic limit. We have to limit of you being zero.
you j being zero. That means that this is the non interacting limit.
And we now say that somewhere in between there will be this critical you for J
where we have a $p$hase $p$osition from the su$p$erfluid into the mud until later.
And the first thing I can $p$lot is the excitation energy. I can say, what is the size of the ga$p$?
The lowest excitation energy. If the system is gaffed, then for a large U of a J.
Over here I would have an interaction. Energy on your order. If you. And this extra energy, there's this ga$p$.
We clear create this ga$p$ with decay down to zero anti$q$uity. Good $p$oint.
use to find it here. But lowest excitation that we can do.
Become Kar$p$lus. It must become gas. That's because we have discussed before that the su$p$erfluid is Ke$p$ner's.
all of a year to get to zero. the lowest excitation energy must be zero.
But here, if we go into the modern insulator and this resume, then it can become finite and it would go u$p$ this.
And for very large you of a J, we just caillat the interactions care you. we have to interactions, can you over here and in here,
it must change in a more com$p$licated manner because it must vanish over here where we have to get this su$p$erfluid.
All of this we can just say from thinking about what we know about from these
limits and from the $p$oint that there must be a $p$hase submission in between. The other thing we can $p$lot is not as auto $p$erimeter.
We can $p$lot the limit of iron. I'm A.J. going to infinity off this coveted u$p$site.
I dig u$p$site, Jane. And we know that in the unordered $p$hase, in the mountain set, it is with zero.
And then it would come u$p$ here. In the su$p$erfluid site, again, we know that the other $p$arameter must be zero, but this financial year.
We know that this would be a continuous $p$hase transition. basically, it works to zero at this $p$oint.
And this is now what we call a $q$uantum $p$hase transition, which is driven by $q$uantum fluctuations and not from the fluctuations.
To talk about this later. It just means for us now that it ha$p$$p$ens in the ground state.
It's TEAC with your. And how does this look and ex$p$eriment?
Well, that's mostly something that you would see in the journal club this weak where we can talk about this also in more detail.
But here is that the main $p$lot of what they got. This is to BEC. In the absence of the lattice Desierto of life $p$ictures, you see the ty$p$ical VCP.
And then if you increased lattice that if you load this into a lattice, you see the satellite $p$ics coming u$p$.
And we talked about last time about that the satellite $p$eaks become stronger for a dee$p$er
lattices sim$p$ly because the $p$lock wave now has more mixtures of the higher order $p$lane weighs.
But then here, between you and gee, something funny ha$p$$p$ens because we see it now, the character of the stage really changes a lot.
We see it see that these shar$p$ $p$eaks really fully go away. And we seem to have a very incoherent state.
And that's the $p$hase transition from the su$p$erfluid into the modern insulator with a $p$hase.
Coherence is lost. Yes. No $p$hase coherence in the system anymore. The $p$hase is not long winch ordered anymore.
And everything is ha$p$$p$ening just on the local scale. And then in a very dee$p$ let us where we dee$p$ in the mud insulator, we will have a much insulated,
as we describe mostly by $p$article sitting on thing and let the sites.
this is just the food transform of any vanua functions that you will get here.
And we discussed these $p$ictures in Maldito Next lecture.
we observe a reversible $p$hase transition, so we observe to be can go into a dee$p$ lattice from here to here, goes away and comes back.
We discussed this more and let us in the journal club. And it will have made a s$p$ecific let us test the reasons we did.
The reasons are given here. The reason is that for larger vnu dee$p$er.
Let us seise the interaction as you increase as moderately. Not too im$p$ortant.
But the tunnelling t decreases almost ex$p$onentially. Remember the $p$lot to be signed last lecture.
that basically means that you of a t when you have a J.
If I want to be back it it decreases almost ex$p$onentially with increasing lattice ste$p$$p$ed.
And that means that in the dee$p$ lattice I ex$p$ect to Martin's lattice,
one of the weaker lattice I ex$p$ect the su$p$erfluid from by changing lattice ste$p$ that can go from the one case to the other case.
And the transition that you can see here is really smoothed out.
It's not as shar$p$ as he would have thought. Maybe from the sim$p$ler calculations, because you're not in the big homogeneous system,
you're in homogeneous system due to the tra$p$ that we were discussing.
Also more in a few lectures. And the last $p$icture for today is basically how we just a $p$hase diagram look,
