Welcome everyone to the quantum simulation class. It's great to be back in lecturing in person. It's much easier than last year, where you just had to sit there after midnight at your desk and record things into the void and you don't see any reactions from anybody. We're very, very glad to be back. And let's directly start.


Quantum simulations is what we're going to do in this course, and we're going to study many body physics. We're going to talk about things magnetism, superfluidity and so on, we really try to look at the key models and the key phenomena, and some of the key experiments that people have used to learn something about these.


We are not going to dive very deeply into the details of the experimental setups, so we're not going to spend four weeks asking, how do you get your atoms cold? I assume some of you have seen this in the atomic and optical physics course. If not, then it's also not a big deal because we're not going to discuss this much. We're just saying, assume we have cold atoms, for instance, or we have another medium for quantum simulations, and see what we can do with it.


We will also not delve very deeply into theoretical formalism, but when we do things superfluidity or insulators or magnetism, we will, of course, have to do a little bit of theory to see where the effects come from and how we can describe them and what's going on. But we really care about the intuitive understanding of the physics. We don't put the focus on the theoretical formalism, that’s where other lectures TQM are relevant; if you have not done TQM, don’t worry, it’s not necessarily needed for the course.


One of the prime examples is a high temperature superconductor. If you put that in the magnetic field, it will just sit there and float. Understanding how you can get high temperature superconductors is one of those problems that’s ongoing in condensed matter physics. What's really going on, why are they superfluid, why do they form a superconductor and other materials do not? It's one of the main motivations of why people do quantum simulations. We'll see in a few minutes why this is something that you need a quantum simulator for, and you can't do just on a classical computer.



Just a few formalities before we really get started. it's going to be 12 lectures, two per week for six weeks. They will all be here in the Ryle room, and if the lecture capture works, they will also all appear on Moodle. If something should fail, we'll put last year's videos on the Moodle, which are maybe a bit more boring, but they have the same content, so they also work. There will be three supervisions. We'll wait a week for those because of course, everybody is initially looking at a few more lecture courses than they really want to take to the end. A special thing that we do in this lecture course, which people normally tend to a lot, is journal clubs. They are voluntary, so if you don't want to come, you don't have to come. They would probably also happen in the Ryle, and we will arrange two dates, also at the beginning of next week, once we know how many people there we are. Students tend to them a lot, so I tend to advertise them a lot. What we do there is we say, OK, if there's one, key result, we look at the experimental paper, how that key result was observed and we discuss that paper in an hour, hour and a half in the journal club. It's also great to get a little bit more behind the scenes of how science works, for example why do you do this measurement? Why do they not measure this regime? What was the limitation here? Why is this one so important? Why stress this point? It helps you to get a little bit into the habit of reading primary literature, reading papers, discussing papers, asking stupid questions about papers. There will be a Teams channel to discuss questions, advertise that also in a in a week's time. What we will do is we take everybody who's registered, so please register for the course if you have not done so, and we put them into a Teams channel, which we can use as an informal forum to ask questions. I can put comments in and put references to papers if somebody is interested. You can contact me via email or via teams. Today we will put some of last year’s handouts on the TIS; at the moment, there is a PDF version of all of the slides that we have, plus a little bit of additional material. I will always release the final PDF for a given lecture, typically on the evening after the lecture, because what tends to happen even after three or four years of going through these slides, is you spot a typo or a minus sign mistake, and then I'll fix them after the lecture and make a new PDF, which I then put online. That becomes the official version for that year, but it's only typos compared to the previous years.



There might be a bit of new material coming in the second half of the course, but we'll have to see. It depends how we go and what you find most interesting. There is no script per se so far, but I am actually hoping to create one this year and there's an opportunity for a student if anyone is interested. This is remunerated, so it's paid being a demonstrator, at an hourly pay rate. The timing when you do this work is flexible. It could be something that we do, maybe directly in parallel to the lecture course; then, at the end of the lecture course, there's a first alpha version of a new handout, which would be helpful for everybody going forward. It could be something that somebody does over the summer when they have time for it. The idea would be that if we do these Panopto recordings, we have a transcript. Panopto automatically transcribes everything, and it's a starting point for text, which we can use to make a script. We have to do a first editing pass, which basically means replacing all those words which Panopto picks incorrectly, and then it goes back to me. Of course, there will then be quite a lot of editing work to do to make this into a proper script, but I think it would help a lot. If somebody is interested in doing this just contact me afterwards after this lecture or after the next lecture, and then we can see how we can set this up.



OK? After all the preliminaries, let's start to dive into the topic.



What we do today is mostly motivation and giving you a flavour of the things to come. If you find that things are going too fast, you don't get them and you would to see a proper derivation more detail, don't worry, we will come back to those things.



The problem, or the challenge of many body physics in general is simply the dimension of the Hilbert space. If you take the simplest possible system you can have, that's a spin one half system (a two-level system) which we now call a qubit, it's basically a system where you have a state that can be spin up or it can be spin down. Any wavefunction can be superposition of the two things with these two complex coefficients, c_{up} c_{down}. You note that the dimension of the Hilbert space is spanned by these two numbers, so it's a vector space of dimension 2. It may be trivial to see that if I have N spin one half systems, there are 2^N spin states.



If I ask you to give me the ground state wavefunction of a three-spin system, then what you have to give me back is basically eight numbers. You have to give me 2^3 = 8 coefficients. This exponential scaling is generic for all kind of many body systems, and that is the basis of quantum simulations, because basically the test is something that you can't do in a classical computer.



If you try to look at typical numbers on a classical computer, (not a supercomputer), the state of the art is on the order of 40 spins. We just write down this big matrix at diagonalise it, and what you can see is that if you have the solution, if you have two states, are you interested in that? That’s already storing around one terabytes of data. Well, one terabyte you can nowadays almost do on your phone; maybe that's OK, but the point is if I take 44, 46, 48 qubits, it's 2^8 terabytes. And if I think about how much memory when you put 300 spins, which is still a pretty modest number, well 2^{300} is the number of protons in the universe; this means that even if I can store one complex number in a single proton, it would take the whole universe just to classically store the wavefunction of 300 spins. I'm saying this every year, and every year I'm amazed by it. It shows you that this exponential scaling is just so big, it has no chance of fully capturing classically what's going on in a quantum system because it's just too many numbers, too many things, too many correlations to take care of. And that's basically where Feynman came in and said, well, if this is generic, then if you're clever, what you do is you take one quantum system, and you use that to simulate the physics and the dynamics of another quantum system. That's the idea of the quantum simulators.



The idea is to take a few quantum systems that we have under very good control, such as ion traps, cold atoms, photons, microwave photons in a superconducting circuit, and put that system somewhere where you have a Hamiltonian which is the same as the one of the complicated model that you want to understand. We can map it on and off a quantum system where you have control and then you have something much more powerful, than the classical computations and that are limited by scale.



Let's start with the system that we're mostly going to look at: condensed matter physics, ie electrons in a solid. You can ask, do we understand them? Do we understand why electrons at some point give rise to an insulator while in other cases behave as a metal and conduct electricity? The answer is well, since 1B physics you understand band theory which tells you that in the metal you have overlapping bands and in an insulator you have a big band gap at the Fermi level. This is not how we want to understand these things. We understand them on the effect of single particle picture.

And when you think about how you do these calculations, what you really do is you are solving the problem for a single electron in the periodic landscape. That's what you do when you do plot equations and all of this, you say, let's take one electron out of this and see what are its possible states. And then you say, OK, I have Fermi statistics, if I have many electrons, I have to fill up the Fermi states one by one and I get a Fermi energy somewhere. And that is a great model, and it works very, very well for many, many things. Unless the electrons are interacting, because then you can have something where you have a strongly interacting system and you get very different states. You, for instance, mey get a Mott insulator.

Is there a state where the band is half filled? Band theory tells me a half events, which would be a metal. But if these atoms, if these electrons have a repulsive interaction, if they want to stay away from each other because they repel each other, then you can have a state, a strongly correlated state that looks this.
[pic]
It's an insulating state where you have one particle localised on each lattice site. And these states are now they mutually Bloch each other. I mean, if you take the red particle down here, it could in principle hop to the left or to the right. Pauli principle would not forbid this because they different spin states. But if there was a repulsive interaction, they don't want to do it because it would cost energy to hop onto the neighbour plane, the interaction energy. Therefore they're not doing it. And this gives rise to this insulating state.

If you want to theoretically describe this, it is what we call a strongly correlated problem where you cannot say, let me suggest the problem for this one particle. You cannot do that because what is one particle does depends on the environment. It depends on whether it is between particles here and here or not. It's impossible to solve the problem for one particle. And then you're back to the exponential scaling, and you can do this for 40 particles, but not 300 particles, and forget about the 10 to the twenty three particles in a real piece of material. That's where the challenge comes from. And this also gives you richness because now you have these localised electrons, so you have localised spins and these spins can interact; you can, for instance, go into an antiferromagnetic state. And we will see later on in the course how if I have such a model which is typically described by a Hubbard model, how the low energy limit of that one in the appropriate regime gives rise naturally to an Heisenberg model which has its own deformities. It is a ground state. However, the really cool part is the following;
[pic]
this is a phase diagram for one of these high temperature superconductors. You have twi axes, the temperature and the doping. Here we have been talking about a commensurate situation where you have one particle per lattice site. What happens if you go a little bit away from that? If you stay on this line up here, you have this insulator. If you go down, there's another temperature and there's this antiferromagnetic state. If I say I'm at a very low temperature and then go out of this at some point you are different, but the order gets lost, and I dope, which means I put in some few extra electrons or a few holes; I go away from this one particle, the site and then the antiferromagnetic auto here doesn't make sense because there's too much disorder in there because it's not ordered. That's fine. That's understandable. What's maybe not intuitive is that then a little bit later, I get a new superconducting phase where these electrons pair up and then they start to roam around freely, without scattering at all. And this is the holy grail of condensed matterphysics, understanding this in detail, because these superconducting wires, they can be made now, they can be made out of these materials and they're extremely important. Without superconductivity, you could not have things an MRI machine, the LHC and many, many other things. And it's very intriguing to an extent, and this is something where still nobody can do proper classical simulations without using approximations. But the problem is, you have to understand if all of your approximations are actually valid or not. We come back to a point at the end today; strong interactions can lead to strong correlations, and as I said, this is exponentially difficult to study because you cannot solve the problem independently for only a few of the particles, you have to solve the whole thing at once because the particles the states do so very much depend on each other.

OK. One thing I should say about the course is that I really it to be interactive, so I am happy for people to interrupt and ask questions all the time because I tend to go fast. I try to make pauses periodically to encourage it. OK. See, no questions. Let's dive one step deeper and look a little bit at the models underlying this. We see the first Hamiltonian; the idea is that when we say we are simulating condensed matter, we're not saying just this one piece of material. Our materials are very, very complex. There's a lot of things going on and we don't want to look at all of these intricacies. What we're saying is let's take a step back and look at a few classes of materials, then look at the important model Hamiltonians that people have come up with in condensed matter physics to describe them. And one of the most famous models for this is the Hubbard model, where the idea is to say, OK, we have a material, a crystal, we have two ions, we have the kinetic bands for the electrons, and there is more shaded areas in here which are hard to see in the projector.
[pic]
But you would say that all of these lower bands here, they are just filled with electrons with it, interacting with doing something. This partially filled band up here, that's where everything is happening. We just concentrate on that as one band. It's a first approximation. The second one is to say, OK, we now use a tight binding approach. We discussed the moving around of the electrons by a hopping process where we say a particle can hop from one site to its neighbouring site with a tunnelling rate that we call J. And then we make a big approximation, but it's a good one, which is to say, let's assume also that the interaction has the simplest possible form. Let's assume that two electrons are only interacting when you're in the same site, then they have higher energy and interaction energy U. These are the ingredients that go into this Hubbard model.

If you write it down in second quantised notation looks this
[equation]
and we go through the individual terms. Basically you have this first term, sum over nearest neighbouring sites. $a_i$ is the annihilation operator, where I take out an ion, an atom or an electron from site i. And then $a_i^+$ is the creation operator insite, which basically says, if I want a model of particle hopping from here to here, I take it out here and I put it back there. That's just a mathematical way. And second quantisation is how you describe this, and I hope everybody's familiar with this kind of notation. And then you just say, OK, well, this $-J$ is the contribution to the energy you can gain by doing this. That's the tunnelling term. The second term is the interaction, which is basically saying number of particles on the site.

And now we were in business because we say what we actually want to do. We just need to have a nice physical, clean implementation of this model. Without disorder, without bifurcations, without phonons, or any of these complications. Just a simple model to study this. And then we can say, let's take a sinusoidal potential in an optical lattice. When we put atoms in there, and they also would satisfy Bloch theorem. They have their band structure that we put them in the lowest of these bands and then they will also hop and they will naturally also only interact when are on the same site. And this is therefore a very nice implementation of this Hubbard model, and the Hubbard model is a deceptively simple looking model. It has no analytic solutions in more than one dimension, and in two dimensions is where exactly these kind of layered materials live. It can only be solved numerically with a lot of difficulty and in some special cases. That's where we come in and say, we can learn something about this by studying what cold atoms do in these kind of systems.


Just to show a little bit about the complexity that can come up, if you just think again of a spin system you've seen, that spin $i$ has two sites. If I have two spins, I have, of course, four states. But I also have interactions that can be, say, ferromagnetic, where they want to have the same spin, or antiferromagnetic, where they want to have the opposite spin. And then you're kind of tempted to say, OK, that's the story.

Because if I now say three spins well, if it's antiferromagnet, I would just continue with this antiferromagnetic chain up, down, up, and that's it. If I have 100 sites, it would just be up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. And that can be right. But the complexity is that you can also have something this.
[pic]
If you think of a triangular lattice then you get new effects, you get frustration, you get spin up here, spin down. here, do I put your spin up or down? That's the same energy, so you have a massive degeneracy microstate and again this gives rise to new effects. Spin density waves, spin glasses, spin liquids is a collective phenomenon that really come from the fact that you have many, many, many of these things coming together and reductionist viewpoint of saying, Well, if I understand you ingredients, I understand the big thing. No, trust me. Understanding a single spin or a two-spin interaction does not yet help me understanding what happens on a bigger scale. It's really emergent phenomena. More is different.

How does this, why does this happen?

So far, it's all introductions, all easy. Now comes the first fun thing you probably all have heard a little bit about: superfluidity. You've heard that helium can become a superfluid. But what does this actually mean? Well super fluidity is characterised by the fact that you can have flow without friction through tubes or equivalently, you can pass an object through a superfluid without friction. If you would throw a ball through a superfluid, it would go on forever, it wouldn't even slow down because there's no friction. That's the theory, and we'll see the same for superconductors in two slides. The formal definition is that there is a finite critical velocity, Landau's critical velocity, below which you have these effects. The story is if you try to push it too hard, get it too fast and it stops and behaves in a different way. We can discuss that later if you're interested. This is pretty spectacular. And there were people that don't necessarily believe in this, and the first experiment really said, no, this effect is going on is the famous fountain effect.

Here's a conceptual picture.
[pic]
You have an open beaker and you fill it up to here with a soup of liquid, which basically means a very, very cold helium below $2K$. The bottom of the bottle is in principle open, but you put a material in here which has so-called super-leak.
It just means it's very, very, very thin channels, very, very thin holes through it. And they are such that a normal liquid cannot really pass through because the channels are so thin, the friction is so big that, yeah, just a little bit $\epsilon$ will maybe diffuse through, but it would be so small you neglect it. However, a superfluid, because it has no friction with the wall, can flow freely through this thing. We have a superfluid out here to see if we can easily flow in and flow out. That's why they call it the super-leak. It's a leak that only lets the superfluid through, but not the normal fluid. And then what you do is you just put an electrical heater in, and it becomes a normal fluid again, then what you have is superfluid coming in all the time, turning to a normal fluid, and now unable to escape, which basically means the liquid level rises and the stuff fountains out at the top.

And people made these pictures. It's a picture from nature you can see, OK, this is kind of bubble.
[pic]
And that's really showing you, yes, this is really superfluid and it has this very spectacular effect. That was the first strong indication that something really, really exists or actually, I should say it's the second, the first indication is superconductivity.
[pic]
What you see here is the resistivity of a normal conductor, say, a piece of metal as a function of temperature. You know, that's the resistivity will go down, get smaller and smaller and smaller as you go to lower and lower temperatures because at some point the phonons squeeze out. But you still have scattering on the imperfections of your material, crystal boundaries and so on. It gets small, but remains finite. However in superconducting materials, you could have very different behaviour. It looks the same, a metal for high temperatures. But then there is a critical temperature below which the resistivity drops to zero suddenly or pretty sudden. This is a phase transition. This was observed at this particular temperature and the first time in Leiden in 1911, in mercury with the critical temperature being 4.2 Kelvin. The superconductivity and the liquid helium was discussed together, because that's kind of the temperature that you can only reach with liquid helium. Once they had liquid helium, they could stick mercury inside and then it turned superconducting before they could reach the temperatures. That's why these things happened at the same time. Here are some data from another material you can really see.
[pic]
Okay, this is now a way higher temperature critical temperature of 90 Kelvin. You can really see it coming down here, then boom. This is not just a cartoon, it's really very sharp. This is measured data. It really drops to zero. At this point, there's a phase transition and suddenly the whole story changes and the system is now a superconductor. 

If you take a superconductor and you make it into a loop and you set a current in motion, the current stays in motion forever. This is the picture I wanted to say earlier.
[pic]
This is a cable from CERN, a normal, metallic conductor. It's rated for 12000 amps. And this is from an earlier accelerator that they had. This thing is this big in diameter. That's what you need to get through. 
[pic]
This one is kind of a newer one. This is superconducting. It's also rated for 12000A. You can see how huge the technical consequences of this are. Right. here is now a slightly interesting plot just taken from Wikipedia.
[pic]
This is the critical temperature of many, many materials for superconductivity as a function of when they were detected. We discussed the mercury, which is a metal. And then you have these green things. You are kind of normal in normal superconductors that are discussed and explained by this [BCS] theory. Can we understand the physics in a slightly simpler model without all of the complications? This is the phase diagram of these things that are just discussed before.
[pic]
The fundamental question, though, is this kind of just below 200K? Is this a fundamental limit? Is there a law of nature that says you can't go beyond here? Or are superconductors at room temperature possible? Have you just not found the recipe, the way of doing it yet? And it's pretty embarrassing for such an important thing that after 40 years, we don't yet have a full answer. Working towards these answers is one of the things that quantum simulators are doing. 

OK. Questions? No? Good.

Another topic which is very interesting in this context is topology. The important idea here is that you can have something called a topological invariant. What you see here is a Mobius strip, which is basically a piece of paper.
[pic]
And this has a winding number. It's a topological invariant, which means once I've put these things together, I can take this, I can stretch it, I can deform it, I can put it up into little ball. Whatever, I cannot change this number anymore. This number is fixed until I go in and we cut the thing apart and change it again. Topological invariannts are things that do not change under smooth, continuous deformations. They are things that are quantised of being zero or one. And then if you change things a little bit, you can change them. The famous example where they show up in quantum physics is the hall effect. In the early 80s, people measured steps in the conductance. You have these plateaus of precise value, and you can change the magnetic field a little bit and it doesn't change. And then people later on could show that mathematically speaking, this whole conductance is a topological invariant because it's basically connected to something called a 
[chart no new] 
and we will see this later in more detail. In the last 20 years, people have found these topological effects everywhere. We have topological insulators where you don't have an external magnetic field, you have spin orbit coupling. We have fractional quantum hall states with any excitations. They're very interesting for many fundamental and applied properties, for instance topological quantum computers and many other things, and they are when you take this quantum hall system, which is, say, the single particle effect and you add interactions to that and you go into extremely correlated regions. We talk more about this in a few in a few weeks. We again have to simulate it, using a synthetic or an artificial gauge field instead of a magnetic field to assimilate this physics.

OK. This is now close to final slide for today, and that's kind of the philosophical side of what are we doing and why are we doing it, why are we doing it the way we are doing? It's very often not useful to write down the full Hamiltonian for a system, because it's just a complex beast with $10^{23}$ variables and you have no chance of solving it. If we want to make progress, we say, can we take a simpler model, like a Heisenberg model, a free electron model, the tight binding model, and can we do something with them? They're very useful to understand the physics in question. As always, does this model capture the world in physics? Is your model too simple? And then very often there's approximate solution does not agree with what the world shows us. And then they're kind of like, OK, it's this approximation wrong? Or is my model wrong?

Now, if you have a quantum simulator, you can do a bit more because you can implement this simple model in the quantum simulator. And you can just look at what is the answer of the quantum simulator. And then you can do something that we call a cross validation, that's very important where you say, OK, well, that's my quantum simulator. In this rare cases, we have a case where I have an exact solution doesn't agree with that. For instance, if you take quantum simulator, it put particles in optical lattice refers to each of the interaction of the free particles to what we expect them to do. If they don't, then there's maybe some issue with the potentials, this disorder or something. But if they do the thing, then we kind of have a lot of control and a lot of trust that the Hamiltonian is exactly correct. By doing this, we can say, OK, well, we know what you do, we can say, okay, well, this approximate solution agrees with the quantum simulator. Yes, that's a way off of approximating this that works. And by this day, we can learn something about the materials if we can say yes, OK. These solutions are required to be a bit serious. And then if we learn something and then we can basically go to the kind of smarter people and say, from the way we understand this with these models, if you want to get your critical temperature for your superconductivity even higher, you try to have to have something where your band is stronger. From that you have a lower effective mass of the particles. Or maybe no, you have to have a band that's less curved. It's flatter because then you have a higher density of states. These are the kind of things that you can then go and say, look, you want to make do with the material. Here's what you have to do make this one bigger. Make this one smaller. That's how you optimise. And for this, you need to have this. You need to have this kind of understanding of your model and understanding of how it hangs together. And that's how these things work. 

If you want people use the analogy of saying a quantum simulator is a quantum wind tunnel and we're still here, we're still at the time of the promise, right? What they really say, OK, well, let's put very simple basic shapes in front of a wind tunnel and measure very basic things. They were not yet about saying, OK, let's construct a Concorde and see if we can see what's going on. They were saying, OK, what is the fundamental relation between the track and the area and the angle of attack and all of those things? They were really trying to hook up the cookbook saying, OK, what are the fundamental laws that we need? And the same thing we have with many body physics. What about the fundamental laws? The fundamental idea is how we have to deal about think about many body physics. It's the same for extremely correlated things. Do you need a different set of rules, a different set of ways of how to think about this? And that's what you didn't do. And that's what we are.

I would say we are in the process of doing, of learning more and more things about many body physics. And then you would say, maybe, OK, maybe at some point this is not needed anymore because we don't have the laws, but will. The Formula One cost designed basically a computer using approximate things where we know that approximations work because we've tested them in wind tunnels previously, but still nonetheless at the very end we say, OK, let's build the thing, build a prototype and for validation. Put it again into the wind tunnel and see whether the real measured experiment agrees with what your simulation does. And if you think about this, you of course, test the car, also the racetrack. But you say in order to really validate your model, you have to put them in an extremely controlled environment where you really know the wind, you know everything when you then you can say, yes, it's it agrees with what I've what I what I expect or not. And the same thing. We have proof quantum simulators. If you have an approximate few and you say, yeah, this is kind of what should happen. And you can go directly back to condensed matter physics and say, Yeah, this is kind of what you should try. But then if it doesn't work out, it could be because they are doing something wrong. It could be because there's no effect and there are complications that you have not taken into account. Even then you say, let's go to a quantum simulator. We really know it's this Hamiltonian. We've checked this, it's these parameters, we've checked them. There's nothing else in there. We've checked it and see where we get the right results. 

OK. That's kind of the spirit of what we want to do. And this is the last slide for today. This is the lecture plan. And that's all I have to say for today. Thank you all for being here. And if you have any questions about anything, just ask.
