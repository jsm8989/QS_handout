OK, I guess most people are finished so we can slowly get started.
2:11
And quick reminder where we ended up last week, we said, OK, the effects of magnetic fields are very interesting.
2:16
They're relevant, for instance, the quantum hall effect, spin hall effect, topological insulators and many, many other things.
2:23
And these topological protected events are very important.
2:30
The problem we have of cold atoms is that we don't directly coupled to a magnetic field in the same way that
2:34
you would do if you would have a charge because you're not charged so you don't have to laurence force.
2:39
And then you have tolerance for so you have no classical mechanical effect and also you don't have know how to form phase.
2:43
And that means that it's very hard to simulate those effects.
2:49
And the idea how you do it is you use like berry phases, which we introduced last week and quickly went through it again and payouts phase,
2:52
as you would see later today, to simulate the effect of the of boom phase.
2:58
Because if you do that, then you basically simulate the whole effect of the magnetic field on the Hamiltonian,
3:02
which means that everything else also follows from that. So.
3:07
We spent quite some time last on Tuesday discussing the very face,
3:14
and we said that the idea is that if I have an isolated state, so no degeneracy is nothing simple system.
3:18
That's not often the tone of the first day to time zero being an aching state of Hamiltonian.
3:23
And then I moved my Hamiltonian around the parameter space, so I slowly changed Hamiltonian in time.
3:29
This could, for instance, mean that I slowly change like the fields of the parameters of a laser field,
3:33
or I slowly change to magnetic field disturbances or as we would see later on.
3:38
If I have a block with a quasi momentum, I will force slowly change the quasi momentum,
3:42
so move the particle around in the preowned zone and to form a closed loop.
3:47
I come back to the original state that basically because I was adiabatic, the only thing I've picked up is a face factor.
3:52
And this face factor we saw has two parts at Anamika Phase, which is just the injection of the energy over time.
3:57
And this berry phase of geometric phase, and we say the geometric phases of face that does not depend on time,
4:03
it does not depend on evolution speaker, which would go around a certain loop,
4:09
but it is fully determined by the geometry of this path that you've take to where you've been in parameter space.
4:12
And then we saw that you can express this in the form of, say, it's the gradient in parameter space of the wave function.
4:18
So it's basically asking if a change is parameter and Hamiltonian versus the magnetic field.
4:24
How does the EIGEN statement that I mean evolves and then projected back onto the state to take it as?
4:28
And then I take the ring into the vector and then it could be kind of the ring integral of the vector along this line of the closed form.
4:35
And that's how I get back to a face scalar. So it's independent of the evolution of speed.
4:43
And then we said that is the part that you put you in the indiquant sorry gradient upside.
4:48
It's called the Bury Connexion, and the cut of that is something that's called the berry curvature.
4:53
And we would see that this is analogous to like the magnetic vector connexion and the magnetic field.
4:59
And one thing that's important to say here is why do we make this emphasis about going around a closed loop?
5:06
Why is this place picked or not defined for any kind of thing? And the answer is that you have a greater freedom in quantum mechanics, civility,
5:13
bigotry, but you have an ongoing feud at the story is actually very simple.
5:19
It's just fancy language.
5:23
If you haven't Hamiltonian where anything I can sort of do Hamiltonian to epsilon energy epsilon, then if you multiply the state end of a phase III.
5:25
Just a number, then, of course, that one is also an icon state of the Hamiltonian,
5:33
because number two, when you commute with just a number, you can just put it through.
5:36
So whatever you define and as you can state or you eat you, the ICAI end, as you can state, that's fully up to you.
5:41
Doesn't change anything in the physics, it's just a face factor.
5:47
It needs to be just a face factor, because we say Oregon State needs to be normalised. But that's the only thing there was about it.
5:51
And this is called a you want freedom because the group of numbers of the from Italy icon what Christ will be number.
5:56
That's the one group, the rotations along the circle, if you want.
6:03
And that's basically just the gay treatment you have to.
6:08
So this makes sense, you can choose whatever basis you want, you can choose the can function in multiple factors and suggest that I can function.
6:12
But this, of course, means that if I say, let's start at this stage here and then move to another point in parameter space and ask,
6:18
what is the perspective that I have here? Well, that's the totally arbitrary, because that depends on what definition I choose.
6:25
For that point, I put it way function. I can always make this face, but it gets to an evolution here.
6:32
Zero, by just saying, OK, let me just change the definition of my way function or my basis date accordingly.
6:36
That adjust end up of a positive parameter in front of it. You can. You could always do that.
6:42
So this is an open path. And therefore we say that this phase of evolution is Professor Gates dependent quantity.
6:46
If you change like, say, the definition of your initial state by multiple factor of the final state,
6:53
then you change the very face it would get along this path. And this age dependent quantities, they are not observable.
6:58
They just think if you wanted something some magical artefact because you can gauge the move where you can make them zero.
7:04
So all of this is for nothing.
7:10
Well, no, because if you take a path, that's a closed path where you start at this one point, go a closed loop and come back to the same point.
7:12
Then it turns out you get a independent quantity.
7:20
Because if he wanted to change the gauge by, say, change the initial state, you get an icon from changing the initial state,
7:24
but you also, on the other hand, get you to the minus IQ from also changing the final state if you initiate the final state at the same.
7:30
It's not too independent face factors that you can change.
7:37
It's the same face with the here and there, and it's you looking at the difference between the two changing.
7:40
It doesn't do anything, so it's a well-defined quantity. It's the same thing as if you would say that if you think of Democratic Victor,
7:45
potentially it's age dependent property, so you can change a lot how it looks.
7:51
But just adding like this, gradient terms to it.
7:55
However, to call off that the magnetic field, that's a gauge independent, real physical property that you can measure in the lab and all of that.
7:58
And that's an element of reality. So the same thing you have here, the face you get along an open path is gauge dependent,
8:05
so not observable because you can always change it by just changing definitions of your states.
8:11
But the face along a closed loop that's independent, that's observable and well-defined.
8:17
There's nothing you can do to change that because it's the same end point, a starting point.
8:22
And also, it also make sense on a very intuitive physical level because you have to realise that the face of a wave function is not an observable.
8:28
How would you do an experiment where you measure the face of a wave function? The answer is you cannot you can never measure your face.
8:38
The only measure like density to measure something is one minus one. You measure a particle is there or not there.
8:44
So you can never measure a face factor. However, what you can always do is you can make it into premature, right?
8:50
We split a wave into two parts. Combine them and interfere them.
8:55
And then, of course, the web interface between these two parts, the relative phase between two parts.
9:00
That's a very well-defined quantity that of the light goes left or right.
9:05
So if you just picture your interferometer in the easiest possible way, and it could probably also already use one of Matis plots here.
9:09
But it's just making you want if you just say, OK, I have my my light coming in.
9:19
Let's think about life is the easiest. There's a beam splitter. I make a machine at the front door.
9:28
There's the second beams that are here and I ask how much light comes out here and how much light comes out there.
9:33
And then you know that this one is proportional to cosine squared off the pace that I pick up along the slope to do the relative
9:38
pace between this path minus this puff and to face this path minus this puff is the same face as the face of this path,
9:44
plus this path in reverse. So it's actually. The face of a closed loop.
9:52
So whenever you can think of something being an interferometer, we really split something and we combine it.
9:59
It turns out that's always kind of a closed loop, so it's also like a physically observable faith factor.
10:04
So this buffer medical staff totally makes sense with what you intuitively think about what can be measured and what not.
10:09
It makes perfect sense. OK.
10:14
OK. And yet here's a guy in the heat that we had last time where we said that the
10:23
very face is a real face that can be measured like the heart of warm face,
10:29
and we say that this very connexion is the same estimate, getting back the potential that the berry curvature is the same as the magnetic field.
10:33
In some sense, this is a special case of this general phenomena. This is a special case of the magnetic field and we base here.
10:39
This is like an arbitrary parameter spaces. It could, for instance, be quasi momentum space in the letters.
10:45
And that's kind of what we're going to look at because we want to combine artificial gauge fields a lot of the time with lattices.
10:51
So what are the consequences of this if we now say we have to spend torture, we can calculate in advance to acquire this bury connexion.
10:59
It turns out if you do the semi classical theory of transport, you know what you normally have like in condensed metaphysics.
11:08
You would say, OK, I have the effect the force of an electric field. That's the absolute that's the point is to force it, act on it.
11:14
And they have the presence of a magnetic field. Then they get this cross to endure.
11:21
And it turns out if you do the same analysis, it is actually done. The Cooper here in TeamGroup 10 years ago.
11:25
Now, it turns out that if you do this, you do the same to me.
11:31
Classical analysis you get the following part you get the point that if I have an
11:34
external force acting on a particle that changes the momentum of the particle, that's novel.
11:38
And if I look at the weird space velocity of the particle harvest of particle moving, I get the first term.
11:42
We just do dispersion relation, which is the normal transport, anomalous transport, the epsilon decay, the cool velocity of the particle.
11:46
And I got an animal a second term,
11:53
which is K Dot cross-border cliff does that vector and the berry phase at the berry curvature at this point in case basis.
11:55
So what this means is that if you have particles and you have, say, a food looks bad and you have a band structure,
12:03
you do have positive, say berry curvature, the band structure, then you will get that the particles will move at the very company.
12:11
You see that direction, you will move along something.
12:18
Dot Cross said the cross product is in there, which basically means that if I have a plot, if I have a force in one direction.
12:20
I, of course, get this movement here, which is along this direction is a block of isolation moving up and down.
12:28
But I also get a sideways movement because it this cross-border issue.
12:33
And that's exactly the same thing as you have in the classical hall effect,
12:37
where you would say that we have a magnetic field in this direction and the particles moving in that direction could have force pushing me sideways.
12:40
So you have a movement dot moving me sideways.
12:46
And it turns out that you can calculate this if you calculate it for a third band and for many, many, many oscillations,
12:52
the first time will average out because you have these block oscillations to go up and down and up and down the first of an average to zero.
12:57
But the second term, we're not average to zero.
13:04
To the second term, we'll give you something that's proportional to the integral of the berry curvature over the whole prevenzione.
13:06
If you have a footprint that's obvious and that turns out to be a number which will come back to the next slide.
13:13
So if you have something that's topological and trivial and you sort of force on it in this direction,
13:20
you will get a response that the whole system moves sideways, like in the hall effect.
13:25
OK. And then you can go to an mathematical story of this and you can say, well.
13:31
What can I do, I can do the following the following thing Let's first start with this picture up here.
13:37
This is a Prius on wheels qualities, and let's say we start with a parameter particle somewhere in the Prius when
13:41
we start here and then we move the particle along this loop parameter space.
13:47
So we exert forces on the particle accelerator for us to be accelerated along like a soccer direction.
13:51
And then we come back to the same point and we can calculate we'll get a very face.
13:57
But you can calculate of to ring and equal off the back of the above Tiberi connexion around this area.
14:01
So you can calculate this one where it's just at the antiquities to ring and taken over this little ring and you calculate the very face.
14:07
Equivalent to using a stroke serum, you could, of course, also say, well,
14:14
that's the the surface area of the integral of the area inside here of the berry curvature.
14:17
That's kind of been close to this. That's the same calculations you do put it on a form effect.
14:22
You can calculate the vector potential along the trajectory, or you can calculate the magnetic flux enclosed by the thing.
14:27
So here, the integral of the berry curvature we call the very flux, and it's again the berry flux and close in this area gives me the very first.
14:32
And the conceptual interesting step is to say, well, let's make this bigger and bigger and bigger,
14:40
such that this path at some point and closes the footprint on. Like this?
14:45
Then the reality along longest war zone is basically the same as calculating the berry curvature over the whole prehensile.
14:52
So is exactly the calculation we also saw in the previous slide when we say, OK.
14:58
And you have to like take the very curvature averaged over the whole prism because all of the states are occupied.
15:02
And now there's a cute mathematical mathematical point, which is really cute.
15:08
It's the point is that when you think of the zone, you no think of it as as quick as a square.
15:12
But you noted, actually, it's a Taurus.
15:17
Because the reason this can block isolations, if you're if your momentum is only defined modulo the reciprocal little spectre,
15:20
then if you add out this part one,
15:27
the less gives you just to the average of the presence of these two edges of the zone that actually do the same line.
15:29
Once you get to one, it's like, what is operation? You end up on the air and on the other side, so they're connected on this side.
15:36
And these two lines appear, they're connected on the other side. So that basically means that this area here.
15:42
It's just like the surface of a Taurus.
15:48
It has no boundary because the prions on its periodic test may be the easiest way of saying it can't have a boundary prions on its periodic.
15:50
And it has the topology of a Taurus because you see two different directions X and Y.
15:57
And if you have this picture, you can then say, OK, well, how does such a curfew look on the tourist?
16:05
Well, it's kind of like a deformed circle somewhere on the surface of the tourist. That makes sense.
16:09
But if I want to go all around the boundaries of this, what do I do? Well, I start with the tourist.
16:14
And let me maybe make another throwing for this.
16:19
And whenever I have not tried a talk for a long time, I go to therapy one woman the first try but and see where we are.
16:31
So this is our tourist. No, it's OK, it's recognisable.
16:36
So let me start at some point this point, say, and then go once around the tourist ones about the tourism direction.
16:41
So if we say I start here and then I go once around the tourist in one direction, so I go here and I would come back to essentially the same point.
16:47
But let me stop just before that point just to make clear what's happening. So that was this line.
16:57
Now let's say I go this line here, I go up to I go to one spot direction to tourists again,
17:01
almost a full rotation, which basically means I go along this axis.
17:06
I go up here, come back down to the back side, come back up here, go to this point.
17:09
Now I'm up here, now I go back, so I go back in the direction that I originally went here.
17:15
But in the opposite directions, I basically kind of following a line parallel to this first line back around the tourists and this direction.
17:19
To hear. And then I go back, I unwind by going back around the tourism, this case,
17:27
that's how I close the loop so you can see how this whole surface here is now.
17:32
Stretched throughout the surface of the Taurus. And now.
17:37
You have to take the appropriate curvature, which is the very curvature. You can say, well,
17:45
I have few room to be discussed on Tuesday and know that this integral of the berry
17:48
curvature over this whole area must be quantised must be mindful of two particles penny.
17:52
You can also say, well, actually, what you're doing here is you're kind of like never really moving, why doing moving, moving around?
17:58
The whole thing is like doing nothing. So because you come back to the same point, which basically means that again,
18:03
for the way function to be like self-consistent to be have only one value.
18:09
It must be a multiple of two pie like the same argument we have of what vortices?
18:15
So there's both mathematical arguments, proofs and unintuitive arguments why this faced possibly multiple of two.
18:19
And then you can just say, Well, okay, did I take this integral and I divide it by two PI, then I get I must get a positive integer here.
18:25
I must say I must get an integer here.
18:32
The number of zero one two three minus one minus two must be something like this because it must the face must be multiple of two points.
18:34
And this number is not quite the first number of such a manifold.
18:41
So we have got to convince ourselves that this number, which is just the interior of the berry curvature, must be an integer.
18:47
And then there was the so-called the famous Tkay and gang thought as promoted in Youth Nightingale in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, in 1982,
18:54
the paper came out and this is one of the papers that followed has got the Nobel prise for it was two years ago,
19:02
two years ago or last year because they could prove that the high conductance must be given by exactly.
19:07
Is away available H.H. times this show?
19:15
No. And this is kind of funny.
19:19
This is kind of like really telling us, know what you think about this transverse movement.
19:24
If you like do this in the appropriate units, what you realise is if I take the whole cloud and then move at once,
19:28
I want to pourrions on in one direction and I think about what a cloud ends up in real space.
19:32
It basically tells us that must have hopped one letter side to the left.
19:37
But to the right, you cannot have hope, like hovered at the site because then that would be stupid because the politics is going to be at the minimum,
19:41
but at the maximum of the potential of it can't be fanatically makes a lot of sense that these steps must be quantised.
19:47
If I go once I want the prayers on One Direction, I must do an integer number of steps to the left or to the right.
19:53
And that's exactly topological protect a transport move exactly one charge around the system doing one cycle.
19:58
Or I say my whole conductive, whole conductance must be precisely quantised with these values.
20:04
And now suddenly the thing that we discussed when we discussed the horrific where we said, OK, why is this number not changing?
20:10
Why must it be one or two and going to be one plus something if I put this order in or temperature or anything?
20:15
Now it makes sense because the underlying structure is that it must be quantised for these mathematical reasons.
20:21
OK, so here's the here's the hall effect again. So this is the equation we saw last time.
20:28
What is not a China? No, understand better what it is. It's the China number is the integral over the berry curvature of the food.
20:33
We for a given bed. And then the case was to this precisely quantised potatoes you.
20:39
Good. And as I said, this is what we want to like a first demonstration of called items.
20:46
And at the end of the lecture today, you will see that we've achieved this or less.
20:51
And then the next goal for the next decade, so to speak, is this one.
20:56
Combining this of strong interactions are getting to the fraction of quantum hall effect. So.
20:59
One other good way of thinking about this, which is a very neat way to think about it, is to say, OK, if I have this whole conductance,
21:05
I have this kind of like topological to protect a transport where the particles move around the edge and all of those kind of things.
21:12
I can think of them also in a different way. I can think of some of them. See, we classically by having these what we call it, skipping orbits.
21:18
So you noted that we have an electron and have a magnetic field.
21:24
Then the election, we move on a little circle Typekit in orbit, and then you can ask what happens if I have such a Typekit on orbit?
21:27
Not in the middle of the material, but at the edge of the material where you say, for instance, the vacuum on upper insulator.
21:33
Then you kind of would say, OK, well, the particle would be on this orbit.
21:38
He hit the boundary and then it would bounce off, reflect off the boundary if it's elastic,
21:42
conserve energy, but it can go off in any direction, whatever you want.
21:46
However, the key thing is because once a speck in the material, it will start to curve again because of the magnetic field.
21:50
So whatever direction it goes on, it will turn around and bounce back against the wall.
21:56
So it is orbits must skip along the wall.
22:00
And then you can think of the magnetic field giving you one set of direction, it's orbiting in one way, not the other way.
22:03
And that basically means that all of those particles up here, they are moving to the right.
22:08
And that's a very peculiar thing, because what this means is that you must have a protected transport here where
22:14
you can't have a diffusive transport because there can't be backscatter. So if I have a particle of what we call this etched channel,
22:19
so on the edge here that moves to the right and you say the purity nobody would say is a beauty channel
22:24
can can make you scatter backwards into a backwards channel where you go instead of K with minus K.
22:30
And normally you always have this K minus K symmetry.
22:37
And that means that it gives you damping of your transmit because the parties are not taking part in the main transport anymore.
22:39
Now, in this case, because all of the particles really have to do this kind of skipping of it, they must go back to the right.
22:46
So and even if you if you calculate this now, indeed, you will see that he has to wait and spend.
22:52
He is the conduction band of the pilot material. And then here is one edge mode that pushes the gap.
22:56
This is the most living. He accepted the edge and you can see that there's only one mode, and it's kind of like always pointing to the right.
23:01
So the only case I was positive in this case, which means it always has a positive velocity to the right.
23:07
So there's only particles moving in one direction, not in the other direction.
23:12
And that's also the explanation for when you go back to the hall resistance that if you look at the longitudinal resistance.
23:16
Which points to a need to apply in the X direction to drive this currently extraction.
23:23
You would see that this longitudinally resistance is actually zero wherever we have these plateaus where we have this past all at once for us.
23:27
We have zero resistance, which basically means that there is no backscatter scattering.
23:33
There's no make transport, no diffusion. The particles that we detect moving through ballistically through the system.
23:37
And it turns out they're moving to the edges.
23:42
And the key thing that we have here for us to take away message for this one is that all of those things, the churn number itself,
23:46
all of those things tell us that in order to have any of those effects, you need to break time reversal symmetry.
23:54
Time reversal symmetry implies that if I have a mode of momentum going in one direction,
24:00
I also must have the mode before the mind is going the opposite direction, so we have to break that.
24:04
And the way you practise and all of these systems is by applying the magnetic field,
24:09
because the magnetic field is the one field that is not symmetric because it get
24:13
a few turns into minus a magnetic field if you reverse the direction of time. And that also intuitively makes sense.
24:17
If you think about electric fields, you have a particle sitting here that creates a magnetic field.
24:22
If you change direction of time, the particles are still sitting here. So the electric fields do the same.
24:27
But even if you have whatever magnetic field, you must have a currency of a particle moving for you.
24:31
Electrons flowing upwards the creative accounting field in this direction say if you change the direction of time,
24:36
you change the velocity of the particles and hence you change the direction of the magnetic field.
24:42
So the magnetic field is the one thing that like is and the time of us goes from B to minus B.
24:47
And if you calculate the berry curvature, which we haven't done yet, but if you would calculate it,
24:53
you would see that time inversion symmetry means that if I go from K to minus K.
24:58
I must also change in direction of the berry curvature,
25:04
so be goes to minus B and then if a integrate of a presence of a positive and negative K, the integral must be zero.
25:06
So time reversal symmetry directly implies that the challenger must be zero. It also makes sense on a classical level.
25:13
What I'm saying is if the particles are accelerated before fast in this direction and then I'm saying they're moving sideways.
25:20
That takes time, reversal symmetry, because why are we moving this direction and not this direction, something my practise left wide symmetry?
25:26
And that's the problem. Time reversal symmetry. So what we actually need to do, and it's a good way of thinking,
25:32
is we need to practically reversal symmetry if you want to be able to find actual number if you want to enable this artificial gadgets.
25:38
So we need to figure a way of how can we interact with code atoms in such a way that breaks time reversal symmetry?
25:45
And that's now for the last half an hour, looking at a few methods of how this has been done in the experiment,
25:50
how this can be done, how this can be implemented. So one method is to use position dependent West states.
25:56
So the idea is that you use several High-Performance states of your item, so that only items in the one one state,
26:04
but also the one zero to one minus one state and then you couple them of laser fields.
26:10
So the topic of geometry that people have looked at, this was pioneered by Minutest also already seven years ago now is to say we have a b c and then
26:16
we have these two laser beams coming in from two directions and they cover the internal state.
26:24
And then we calculate the twist states. The EIGEN states will do the calculation also on the programme, sir.
26:29
And you see that these laser fields have slightly different frequencies on my girl and omega plus omega.
26:33
And if you now calculate what happens, I need to think about the three Asian states of rubidium, so we have every good one in this case.
26:39
So we have MF plus one zero and minus one and those three states,
26:46
they have different energies because of the Z1 splitting Omegas that this desirement splitting, we apply of ordinary magnetic field externally.
26:50
This will not give rise to any loans for us on something because the particles are charged,
26:58
but just provided Zeeman effect, which means that these three energies, these two states have different energies.
27:02
And then we can copy them 52 days, a few hours of one photo from the plaque and one photo from Vietnam.
27:07
And what's kind of crucial is that if you apply a significant magnetic field,
27:12
you not only get the linear Zeeman effect, you also get the first, the second or a quadratic Zeeman effect,
27:16
which basically means that if these laser fields a little bit, the retuning starter epsilon delta here, they have opposite signs on these two sides.
27:21
So we have to continue. And now I get by having them in the presence of these laser fields.
27:29
It's a three level system I can calculate. I can states the so-called red state, and they will all depend on the rabi frequency.
27:36
So the intensity of the laser light and on the shooting of the laser light and those parameters, they cannot be spatially dependent.
27:42
So you see how we're getting back to this kind of berry phase type Hamiltonians,
27:49
where we said that the parameters of the Anatolian depend on where you are.
27:52
So you get position dependent West states and the position dependent effect. So if you do this.
27:56
You can say, for instance, if I have a geometry like this, you can say, well, actually I can write down my wave function is a position of three terms.
28:03
The particle can be in state zero. This one and have momentum.
28:10
So we only care about the momentum in the X direction here.
28:15
This is this direction, because that's where the two laser beams have different momentum, different kicks.
28:17
I can also say the particle absorbs like a photo from the one beam emits a photo
28:22
and into the other beam and thereby changes its changes its Mastcam-Z state.
28:25
These states have different energy, so only the one way also changed. My magnetic energy is resonant.
28:30
So that must be happening. So I go from zero to the state one and I get like a kick off to kill, or I can go to minus one and get a kick of minus two.
28:35
So these are the three basic states we now have to play with, and we can execute it,
28:45
we can calculate the states what we get of those and you can you will do this with help on the problems propensity.
28:49
So if you have this kind of situation and agree to a position of two different momentum and a different spin state.
28:55
And you do time of light in the appropriate way, you get a picture like this. So it is this time of light together with stronger imaging.
29:01
So if you radiant during time of light along this direction.
29:07
So to interpret this, we basically have like three clouds, we have a cloud of momentum,
29:12
zero economic momentum minus two in a cloud of momentum, plus two. This should be these three components.
29:15
And the other imaging tells us that, oh, actually the one in the middle is also the one with spin projection zero.
29:21
So like it should be this one and the one up here with momentum plus two is the one with Webster in-state minus and state minus one.
29:27
As it should be, these things like on the diagonal line as it should be, because it's only these kind of transitions that are being done.
29:36
OK, and now you calculated it, which you do numerically to three, but remember, Tony,
29:43
that you can't calculate numerically what you see here is always everything expressed in units of cakes.
29:48
So off the momentum of the zero component. And then you know that if I take this, the plus one component has its momentum shifted by scale.
29:54
So if you take the correct parabola here, that's the unperturbed uncoupled state zero, which is like a parabola centred around momentum zero.
30:02
The parameters for the first eight plus one is shifted by two cail to this side,
30:11
and the one for the other one is you have to buy minus took to that side.
30:16
And then crucially, these three parabolas live at slightly different energies.
30:20
That's because two different tunings that we have here in the two laser beams, in the laser beams.
30:24
So you see that this one parabola is slightly lower than this parabola.
30:28
OK, if you know how to put on the coupling terms between the Robin transitions put on the Omega,
30:33
what you get is you get this crossing again turns into divided crossing at the states,
30:38
repel each other like they always do, and you get curves like the red curve down here, the queen curve up here and a blue crop up here.
30:42
And the main point here is, I mean, intuitively,
30:50
it makes sense that the curve looks like this at this curve is always repelled from the lowest states by this coupling,
30:53
and it's intuitive that this one has a minimum not at zero, but shifted to the right because this state is slower than that state.
30:58
OK. And that's all of the magic that you need, because you can go on and say,
31:05
let me write down an effective Hamiltonian that describes this part down here to this relation and effective low energy Hamiltonian.
31:11
So what I do is I just write this as a parameter around its minimum.
31:18
So I write this as a form of power squared k max minus came in squared over two Instagram stars and effective models,
31:22
just taking care of all of the factors. So I just have to say it's a shift, a parabola K minus Cayman.
31:29
Which I cannot interpret as K minus Q Times a quote unquote.
31:36
So I'm saying I've not created an artificial gauge field. That means that have shifted the minimum of the property to a finite momentum.
31:40
Because that's exactly what you think of when you do this canonical part of looking at the moment a magnetic field,
31:47
you say it's K minus Q a absolute squared.
31:53
So this shift here is the effect of an artificial creation.
31:59
So voila, we have now created an artificial gaits field, so we have created an artificial vector potential for particles in the slowest west state.
32:04
That's pretty cool. But it's, of course, purely mathematical at this point, it doesn't have a physical consequence because, as you know,
32:13
the gauge fields are dependent, so just having created something a constant gauge of it doesn't do anything.
32:19
It just means that a different mathematical description.
32:25
What you need to do in order to get real magnetic field is you need to make sure that you also have a kernel of this thing.
32:29
If Ace constantly is filled, so you need to add a spatial dependence to a.
32:36
So you need to have different West states at different points. And the way to do this is not to add this little thing to your setup.
32:40
So basically what you're doing here is you create a gradient in the ordinary magnetic field that you put in for these images.
32:48
You make you feel stronger at some places than other places. And basically what this does is it creates a spatially varying bit unique.
32:54
So you retuning how different is to three parameters are shifted that depends on the position where you are.
33:01
It's one position it would be the same at one position, it would be very strongly shifted.
33:07
And that basically means you have spatially varying trust states. So you have is basically burying vector potential.
33:10
And they can actually be simulate and calculate this vector potential and can say OK as a function of the position,
33:17
why we just this position along which they have this magnetic field gradient, the vector potential at some point is zero.
33:21
That's what this parameter is centred in the middle.
33:27
That's where, like all of the Zeeman chips are the same and all of the three states that have the same energy.
33:29
And then you go to the One Direction.
33:34
This minimum becomes what we call this the minimum shift to the left, to the right, and you go higher up and the boom shifts in the other direction.
33:36
So this is not something that should create an artificial an artificial magnetic field,
33:44
because if you have two cities gradient in there to one zero, you would expect a magnetic field.
33:48
And if they do the same time of light imaging, they did before. And lo and behold. You can see vortices appearing in this cloud.
33:53
And as we said before we were talking about a rotating system, the vortices,
34:01
our smoking gun of the simulating magnetic field because they show you that this magnetic
34:05
flux is piercing through and you get this rotation about the local magnetic field.
34:08
So, yeah, they have made it they have created an artificial magnetic field by doing this.
34:14
It's a little bit of a tour de force to get there, but I wanted you to understand the structure.
34:20
That's why I went about this in quite a bit of detail. What they can also do is they can also change this magnetic field in time by, for instance,
34:24
changing this gradient in time or by, for instance, switching on and off the lasers or changing the rugby frequency.
34:33
And then they get a type of derivative of the spectre potential.
34:39
And this time derivative, of course, gets Watson artificial electric field and then a subsequent paper,
34:41
if measured as it could confirm that this actually works exactly as you would expect from as textbook.
34:46
And again, like Cooper and John Daly, but they then said, OK, can we make this stronger?
34:52
Because the problem that you have here is the the dynamic range of your vector potential is
34:57
kind of limited because here you only look at the one minute here you only have a minima.
35:02
There's not that much how you can change it, so you can't create very strong magnetic fields.
35:06
So they asked can equate stronger magnetic fields, and the answer is yes, you can very, very strong ones if you like,
35:11
put in like interfering letters beams that kind of create these gradients of your optical potentials and very,
35:16
very small length to and then because of lambda over to so you can do very, very strong fields in this case.
35:22
And if they calculate the band structure in this kind of what they call optical flux letters,
35:27
you can actually see that the band structure of this one has a density of states down here, and it's one very, very sharp, lowest level.
35:31
And that's what you expect for energy. Bottom them whole systems because you expect that you have very, very sharp Landau levels, lambda quantisation,
35:37
where all of these little Typekit and orbits, they have the same energy because they just a different positions.
35:45
But it's the same state, same orbit, and therefore they all have the same energy.
35:48
You get this massive degeneracy and the lowest level. So on the theory side, this works.
35:52
On the practical side, though, there's a problem with this approach, because normally when you think about what we do with Typekit troops,
35:59
you say we live off the fact that the deeper potential is like intensity of a delta.
36:04
Why this kind of thing we get this kind of thing where you depends like intensity of our data's clear.
36:09
So we say that normally if you just like, make this one,
36:14
we get the inevitable scattering if you just go for a very strong retuning and a very strong electric field.
36:17
The problem with these Raymond rate, which you corrected, I chipped, is that they also look like one, would that just quit?
36:22
Which basically means that the tuning doesn't help anymore, and you get a significant heating rate from those covering it just.
36:29
So it's not really practical for many ethical items.
36:35
People are now trying to do this for atoms like strontium, for instance, where you have states,
36:39
where you have very, very narrow lines that you should be able to do this with like less heating with.
36:44
But this is one way of doing it, another way of doing artificial foods is to say, can I do periodic modulations?
36:49
Can I take my system and shake it, say clockwise?
36:57
Because shaking it clockwise is, of course, the time it was a partner of shaking it counterclockwise.
37:00
So we're shaking it in this circular manner. I directly break time reversal symmetry.
37:05
Right and the left hand. So I practise cemetery by hand, by shaking it, and then I should see similar effect.
37:11
And the easiest way to see it is to say, let's take, say, a graphene Typekit at us,
37:16
and let's say we do something where we switch on the different tunnelling elements at different times.
37:21
So for the first third of the cycle, we only have this tunnelling on for the second part of the second.
37:25
We have this tunnelling on and for the last part of the cycle, you have this tunnelling on.
37:29
And of course, if you have this tunnelling on, we also have this one on and this one on.
37:34
So all of the ones that are horizontal and all of the ones that are kind of like upper left and then all of the ones in the upper right.
37:37
And if you do this and if you think of a state at the Edge, say you have to sequence, you say, OK, well,
37:43
it once just goes down this way, but it can't really go any other way because have a ton of things off.
37:48
And then the next point I switch on the horizontal tunnelling, it can only go there. It cannot go any other way because they are off.
37:53
And then I have to ones in this direction. You can go and you go up there.
37:59
There's no other way you can see that this one must also in the sequence, follow kind of like a skipping orbit type thing just around the edge.
38:01
So the mutilation breaks time and symmetry. Fundamentally speaking, it's because one to three is clockwise and three two one is counterclockwise.
38:10
And they're not identical. And they are time reversal patterns of itself. So if I take a one day system, just check it left right.
38:18
That's a sinusoidal modulation. The point is to time you and symmetric what?
38:26
But if I take something in 2-D, where do it kind of like in a circular fashion that does break time reversal symmetry?
38:30
So that's something that people have tried and indeed where they could see first effects.
38:37
This, by the way, goes back to Duncan Haldane, who also got the Nobel prise for the Typekit holding model,
38:41
which is basically to say Can I have your numbers and quantisation without a big external magnetic field?
38:48
And what he could show is that if you take graphene type lattices with like, complex nearest neighbour hopping,
38:53
so hopping from here to here, then you can come up with something that look, that looks like you have got Fluxus.
38:58
We have not got getting fields pointing in and out of the sphere at different points of the Unitel, such as the average magnetic field to zero.
39:04
But you can still have bands with Panopto numbers. And.
39:10
This model was actually realised in cold atoms in the group of two men where they basically said,
39:16
OK, we create letters in slightly more complicated fashion with interfering laser beam.
39:22
So again, we have laser beams going back onto the camera and back in there.
39:26
And because we have the same frequency now going into directions, we get like interesting cross terms,
39:30
which gives rise to this kind of like a structure that we need here. And then we can do the shaking.
39:34
But just like really physically shaking the pizza mirrors,
39:39
putting the mirrors on pizzas and move their positions because it creates the whole light field wide,
39:42
when you think of an interfering electric field, you'll always have like a note at the Mirror.
39:47
So if you move the mirror, the whole light filled with two notes and notes shifts around in space.
39:51
And by this, they could actually, like, try to like, get a structure like you what you had there,
39:57
and they could basically show that you get hold to if they could measure how it and the one direction or in the other direction.
40:01
This was done over these close to 10 years ago, and they could observe all troops, but they were very small and they were not quantised.
40:08
So it was not an integer quantum hall effect, if you want, but it was like a simulation of the classical hall effect.
40:15
And this was basically where things are regarding free space and regarding weak lattices.
40:23
There was another direction which is maybe more fruitful, which is like going into deep lattices and going to type binding models.
40:30
And that's what we're going to talk about next. How can I create artificial gauge fields in a tight binding model?
40:36
So the idea here is now let's look at the last phase factor that we have to discuss payouts faces.
40:42
Pilot phases is basically just saying, let me take and let us let us craft.
40:49
Let me take Hopkins and if we make some of those Hopkins complex.
40:54
So the wait on my Hamiltonian, I would just say this example, for instance, to hopping in the vertical direction.
40:59
Just that is just the same. But if I think about the hopping in a horizontal direction again, the AKP takes you to the AK to India.
41:04
So I get like different phases, phases, my way function.
41:12
When I just hop around, I just take a complex hopping elements like an extra face factor whenever I hop from one side to the next.
41:17
And if I do this, this kind of like face it to acquire, if I want one cat fights, if I one minus my two in this case.
41:24
This simulates the effect of a magnetic flux, because this is exactly the same as the hand of boom face.
41:32
If you have a charged particle, if you would have a magnetic flux encapsulated in this unit, so.
41:38
So you just need to make your shopping complex and you need to make your shopping complex in a way that's basically dependent.
41:46
So do you have like especially repentant backed up potential and then you can get like a magnetic field or an effective magnetic field out of this?
41:52
Does anyone has an idea how we would do this? How can you make your shopping complex?
42:01
What it's maybe a hard question to ask, because the answer is maybe not so obvious.
42:16
Before we get to that, just quickly something about my colleague Unités.
42:21
If you have no office where you like a quiet office fi going around one placard, then this face pie can in principle, be anything.
42:26
It doesn't need to be liked. It doesn't need to be related to Feyenoord, the magnetic flux quantum, which would be a perspective to pay.
42:33
However, what you can always we can almost always do is you can say that's created because the so-called magnetic units,
42:42
which is a super containing several unit cells, just caters to between things.
42:47
Such tough luck that the flux to this whole magnetic unit cell is just a multiple of two PI.
42:52
If you, for instance, would say, if I have a flux of PI over two and this and paper two in every cell,
42:57
and if I go to four four units out, I go, they're going to pay.
43:03
And this is not saying like I have a super lettuce with like four letter sides pursued by lettuce,
43:07
which then tells me they now expect that there's one band that originally had with split into force up bands.
43:13
So basically, what get you in this case is I get that split into end magnetics happens and all generality,
43:21
and they would be subject to some of the Chernov as well as this happens would be zero.
43:26
So it's kind of interesting to look at all of those happens and see how many
43:30
you have and what kind of configuration and how many assumptions you have.
43:34
We virtually just depend on this factor fi, how much pace you pick up per unit.
43:38
So when you hop around. If it's pie, then you just have, like, say, two units, do you expect to bend if it's a pie of a two,
43:43
you expect four units, so you expect for bands and so on. And then one of the first person to look at this systematically removed data,
43:50
and then he came up with this kind of plot that was kind of one of the first fractal structures showing up in physics.
43:57
And it's now famous, hopefully the butterfly and probably some of you will have seen this picture somewhere on the internet at one point or the other.
44:03
I see a few people nodding, but not too many. OK, so what do you got here?
44:11
What you brought here is the plot,
44:15
the energy spectrum in a normalised form and applauded as a function of the flux Phi Phi and units of fine not can go from zero to one.
44:16
If you look at zero, the very edgy you get like one line going from up here to down there, that's one single event.
44:25
That's the bet that you have about the absence of magnetic flux.
44:32
If you look at the next obvious points here, point of one third this year you see three lines, you see this line here,
44:35
the line here in the middle and the line up here because you have three bands,
44:41
you see, there's no three bands separated by band gaps, three nice bands.
44:44
What you also will see is that away from these simple fractions, like one half, one third and so on.
44:48
Stuff looks pretty, pretty complicated and pretty pretty fractal. And that's by design.
44:53
Because if I take say, for instance, any irrational flux where a fight over Panopto stock just a rational number, then it could end going to infinity.
44:58
I have infinitely many points of view, many bands. And yeah, so it's really a fractal.
45:06
If I go to something with whatever, 17 over seventy nine and a half seventy nine bands.
45:10
That becomes very, very complicated. So we have this factor energy structure.
45:16
You might be asking if I look at one half, I see it as one banshee in the middle.
45:19
Well, actually, it's two bands, it's one band going from down here to appear in the middle and another band from here to there.
45:24
There's no guarantee that these bands must be separated by band caps.
45:29
They can be touching, but still, we know it's two bands because we know there's two solutions for each quasi momentum.
45:32
And it looks a bit like a butterfly, that's what they call it, hopefully this butterfly. OK.
45:40
Now back to how can we implement these payouts faces? The way it was done and this was done, they're in a whole series of experiments for many,
45:46
Heidelberg was the main person and this is to say, well, if we want to do complex hopping,
45:53
say along the extraction, the first thing we have to do is we have to stop this real hopping, to bear hopping, to bear tunnelling in the X direction.
45:58
And the easiest way of doing that is to say, let's do that as such that we have a delta here that you need from,
46:05
let's say, to let the site that's much bigger than the original. So that and tunnelling can't happen because the energies don't match.
46:10
So then you end up with basically like hopping along the y direction, but no hopping along the.
46:17
And then what you can do is something to be called laser assisted hopping or laser induced hopping or Ramon assisted tunnelling,
46:23
which is basically saying let's put into extra laser beams one here, one there.
46:29
And it's put him in such that the edit, the frequency difference between these two laser beams is exactly delta.
46:34
Which is basically saying, if I observe a photon from one laser beam and emitted into the other laser beam, I gain or lose an energy of data.
46:41
And if that data is exactly the same as this data here, then this now restores the tunnelling.
46:47
So I can do a laser assisted tunnelling, whereby if swabbing a and from one laser emitting another laser, I go from one little site to the next.
46:53
That's the area. And then you can ask, OK, what happens now to the face pictures?
47:01
What do I get faces? Well, if I absorb and amid a photo, they're always absorbing images, also the face of the laser beam.
47:07
So to face it, I get by doing so depends on what the face into the eye of this laser beam and that laser beam is at a position of right doing this.
47:13
And because Italy ICAC's of the one that Italy likewise, if the other one, of course, battery dependent.
47:23
The crucial point is that the face factor I get out of this is basically dependent.
47:29
So if I jump here and then maybe go up some direction, why didn't we jump back or we get another face up here from the laser beams?
47:32
Then it got down here, so if it didn't go for a loop, I would have acquired a face while going through this.
47:40
That's the main idea. And you can basically just take geometry and calculate if I have a given key vectors of my lasers, hear this case.
47:47
They're kind of like orthogonal, but they don't have to be.
47:54
I can put them in any kind of angle and I can calculate just from this angle and the key vectors.
47:56
What is the magnetic fox that will be simulating?
48:00
Because that tells me what is the difference, the difference in the face vectors of the different popping elements at the different points?
48:03
Strictly speaking, because we now have to start and not being on zero.
48:14
This whole Hamiltonian this whole time depends why, because we have to each acre x minus omega T,
48:17
we have a tiny bit of omega one minus omega two times T, and they're so strictly speaking.
48:23
It is also like a special case of this kind of flukey engineering of this kind of Truven Hamiltonian.
48:27
And you don't have to have to face up to two laser beams. We just kind of like also shaking in a certain way.
48:33
So you can also think about it in this way.
48:37
But very often people say, OK, let's only consider the resulting effect of time independent Hamiltonian, which people don't quite know.
48:39
Harper hopefully the Hamiltonian, which is the Hamiltonian where you just say,
48:45
let's put complex toppings on all of the toppings in one direction and then have those peas basically dependent.
48:49
And that's exactly the way that they diagonals. When you got this plot to move to the butterfly, they showed you on a previously.
48:56
So what can you do with this? The first example that you can do is people did something where they said, Okay,
49:04
let's take a super letters and the X in the right direction so that we have
49:08
like little placards and just like no time and coupling between the placards. So we just put particles on like a of foresight letters.
49:11
And if you put particles on a superposition of these two sites initially say here we can measure all the particles are of super lattice techniques
49:18
and we can look at the time evolution of the particles so we can look at the expectation value of X and Y of the particle as a function of time.
49:25
And this plot here shows you, like many, many measurements and like clue to right is kind of like off the dots.
49:33
It's kind of like the way time progresses.
49:39
And I guess the main thing to say here is this is something that also gets around like this in the time, in the time or at fashion.
49:41
So you really see that it starts off field that is really going clockwise. It's like a little Typekit in motion.
49:48
It's really like the particles kind of doing Typekit and motion on this little side block at.
49:54
So it really shows you one of the main effects that we would expect from coal that from from the magnetic field, you do see cycles in orbit.
49:58
You can do the next thing which they then did was to say, OK, let's connect many of these little black heads up together to one dimensional stripes.
50:07
And what they could show then by looking at the flow of the particles and the currents of the particles,
50:14
they could show the analogue to what you normally have in a superconductor device.
50:18
No effect would actually get like a surface current to kind of counteract the external magnetic field.
50:21
So they could show here that because of these pacemakers you get,
50:26
you get something where particles are flowing upwards on the right hand side and downwards on the left hand side.
50:29
The cable covered so current, it has like a corollary to it it's going counterclockwise direction, but not the clockwise direction or vice versa.
50:34
And then the latest experiment in this one,
50:43
and this is the last experiment I want to show it is to say we can try to measure the high response so we can try to say, let's take a cloud.
50:46
Put a force in one direction to take a cloud with this kind of pilot's phases,
50:54
with this laser system stopping going on now at an additional force in one direction to
50:58
push the particles in one direction and then measure up a cloud move sideways measures,
51:03
if ever there is an animator's velocity. So the external fast and I do have an optical gradient,
51:07
so they put like a big laser beam somewhere where the clouds are sitting on the edge of the laser beam,
51:14
so they see an intensity gradient so that I can potentially see force pushing
51:18
them in one direction and then they measure what happens in the other direction.
51:21
They now do the pilots paces again, but they do them in a slightly different scheme for technical reasons,
51:27
and they get like a face off to PI over four. So they get like that for the two sides now do one of doing one of those magnetic units out,
51:31
which basically means that they are now in this situation and the hopefully the butterfly.
51:40
There's four bands one band down here, 20 in the middle of which touch yet at this point and another band up here.
51:44
We noted a number of the some of the numbers must be zero.
51:50
That's what we get on with the butterfly.
51:54
But we also know that we can have a situation where if you go to the right parameters, the lowest band would have a higher number of one.
51:56
The upper bands would also have a minimum of plus one,
52:03
and the two bands in the middle of attaching have a combined channel of minus one to make all of this viable.
52:06
And then they had to get a lot of ideas into it from how do I go from a non topological
52:11
Hamiltonian into a topological system in such a way that they end up only in this lowest band?
52:16
That's a big problem, actually, if I have a non topological system,
52:21
how do I make a topological with all the populating all four of those bands and therefore not having any effect?
52:25
But they managed to do this, they managed to put all of the particles in this lowest band at the time to with zero.
52:31
And this now is my final slide. Hence I'm rushing a little bit.
52:36
What they look at now is they say we look at the differential shift where the particles,
52:41
if I put a in is that direction move to the left or to the right.
52:46
There's two plots in here one place with the force and the plus that direction one force in the minus direction.
52:50
And you can see that in the one case, the drift in one direction. In the other case, they drift in the other direction.
52:56
So here you see, this is like differential density measurements.
53:01
So you take two.
53:06
Density measurements, one before, one after, and you look at the difference between them, you see that if you do this and this kind of case,
53:07
you see those like blue,
53:13
red and you have a case he does where plumes of the particles are moving a little bit to the left or a little bit to the right.
53:15
And you can see as a function of time how many observations you do, you can see that initially there was a straight line here initially.
53:21
They are moving initially you see a shift, you see this block to that. You would expect this whole trip that you would expect.
53:28
What you also see is that, well, that kind of stops after a while after 120 milliseconds, the particles are not moving anymore.
53:34
The answer for that is that for longer times, dispensary population.
53:41
Because when you try a system, when you shake a system to give if a proven system in the Iraqi case,
53:46
then what you also have you allow the system to absorb energy from the drive and go to other states.
53:52
So that means that the system is not confined to the lowest energy band anymore,
53:56
but can be redistributed to all of the energy bands and with mapping techniques with time of flight, they control it.
53:59
That's what's happening.
54:04
So they can show that they expect nothing to happen here anymore because the system now isn't equipped with equal mix of all four bands.
54:06
But for the small part, down here, you can do a fit, and if you do a fit,
54:13
you get something where to expect extract is zero point nine, nine, seven or above or five.
54:18
So it's very, very, very compatible with the theoretical value of one.
54:24
So this can be seen as like, yes, this is like a first observation of the integer quantum hall effect in atoms.
54:28
It has a lot of caveats, I should say it's not in full glory, right, because it's not like a steady state that stays forever.
54:36
It's a transient effect. It's only there for like the first couple of milliseconds before it gets away.
54:42
But it shows that it can be done in principle.
54:47
So this was 2015, so six, seven years ago, and people have now put a lot of time in understanding of limitations.
54:49
How can we do this in a way to not have this bad redistribution later on?
54:55
How can we extend this to a longer times? Because if you want to go to the fractional quantum hall, you want to combine this with strong interactions.
54:59
We need to have the system being alive and being topological for like a half a second because of the interactions.
55:07
Everything is more fragile and go slower.
55:12
But I think it just shows you that this is maybe it will end quantum simulations are far from at the end of what they can do.
55:16
They are still pretty exciting things that will come up in the next couple of years, going to what fractional quantum hall on this side,
55:23
going towards like the antiferromagnetic spin liquids and other interesting quantum states and quantum magnetism.
55:29
There's many, many developments that are currently underway. Lots of things are going to come.
55:34
OK. And this stunt is the official end of the course.
55:39
Thank you very much.
